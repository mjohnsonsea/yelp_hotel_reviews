2982,-ZkzDLAp-6LSdek-nU,"My husband took me to stay the night for a fun date night one year and I'm finally getting around to writing a review of this place. Well, it's the W hotel, which obviously means it's stylish, cool, trendy, all in once place with an exceptional location in Chi-town overlooking Lake Michigan. We were there in the winter so I can't speak for spending time outside the hotel facilities so we definitely took full advantage of the inside. The people at the lobby were super nice, the decor was fab-u-lous throughout and the actual hotel room was spacious, clean and had a very chic feel to it. We left as happy guests. The best part of the hotel is that it houses Wave restaurant which is like Mediterranean tapas and it's absolutely delicious and definitely cost effective. This 4 star hotel is a great location to stay for both tourists, locals and even if you're on business trips, the concierge will be friendly and polite and the bar is definitely worth checking out and if time allows, make a reservation at Wave. And I have to mention that I got a really good night's sleep when we stayed our one night, bed was super comfy and those pillows, I was seriously contemplating taking them home with me.",4,0,0,0
2983,9yStfyRS5CISu-May43dmA,"stayed at the property over the weekend, got a fantastic rate on priceline. We took the blue line to Clark/Lake and then took the taxi to the hotel. Check in process was smooth, we had a wonderful room with a view of buildings across the street. Room was nicely furnished, flat screen, high beds, window shades between bedroom and bathroom. The room smelled nice and the furnishings were in a fine condition. We got a glimpse of the rooms with a view from the elevator waiting area - it looks our directly at a beautiful beach with Navy Pier to the right. I can imagine how amazing it must be to wake up with that view in the morning. It was raining on Friday night, we asked to use the hotel umbrella when we went out for dinner but apparently they were all out. The agent at the front desk offered us her personally umbrella but we declined (I think her name was Arianna - great service). We also had forgotten the charger for our iPhones, although they weren't able to send us one for our room, it was no problem to stop by the front desk and leave it there to charge in the back. We did that for 2 nights. The welcome desk was a little chaotic the two times we needed to speak to them, and when we did their attitude wasn't entirely pleasant. That was the only minor flaw to the hotel besides the unusually slow elevators that seemed to stop at every floor every time we needed to go to the lobby. We had plans all weekend, so didn't get to use the pool, restaurants or bars on site.  We rented a zip car for 2 hours for our little excursion on Hot Doug's on Saturday morning. The car was parked a block away in a lot, very convenient. Other times we took the Red line (Chicago), explored the city on foot, and at the end of the night we took the taxi to the hotel. The W Lakeshore is located a bit far from the river and Michigan Ave. but the lake view is simply breath taking. If the weather was warmer, the pedestrian path by the lake and the beach is just across the street. Perfect for someone who wants to go for a jog or just relax by the water.",3,0,0,0
2984,Wf-7bJszS2n6REXGbrwK2w,"Overall, I think I'm less and less a fan of the W concept. This hotel has both good and bad. The rooms are very updated and comfortable, but- the soundproofing stinks. Had to swicth rooms and still was awakended by noise the next morning. The staff is very friendly, but- they are so friendly it takes them forever to check you in, so the folks behind you get to wait. The location next to the lake is great, especially if you have a lakeview, but- it's also far from everything else, with few amenities in immediate walking distance. Probably will hit up the Westin on my next stay. But if you're in the mood for the hipster scene, this might be your place to stay.",3,0,0,0
2985,ZLe,"I'd like to make a confession. I don't really like W hotels all that much, but I REALLY don't like this one. Whatever. Whenever... though personally, I'd like to put a little more emphasis on 'Whatever'. I don't like walking into what looks like a club with blasting music and $16 martinis in the morning. I don't like feeling like you have to be sexy at 8am, 2pm and 4:00am in the morning after you've been rained on all day/night and the concierge at W hotel has the nerve to recommend the Hangge-Uppe as a decent after hours bar... for that cruel joke I should actually give 1-star but I'll be kind regardless of what my ovulation cycle is telling me. I will say that I do enjoy the quirky rooms at most W locations, though I feel like this W is lacking the quirky and leaning more towards stuffy. I don't like being ignored by the bartender or being carded by the same one twice in less than hour after not moving seats. Never has there ever been a more invisible neon orange-haired person than at the W Lakeshore's bar. I know most people probably come here from out of town, but my experience was for a weekend-long and God-forsaken bachelorette party so I was more than non-plussed when I found out that parking here over the weekend would cost me close to $200... a price that I simply can't afford, and would refuse to pay for parking anywhere regardless. I ended up hitching a ride with the bride and husband-to-be so that worked out, but then we'll get into the nitty-gritty of paying what the room rate for this hotel is vs what you get. On a typical rainy, chilly and windy as f*ck Chicago day, I wouldn't consider the W Lakeshore to have much of a view. Looking out the windows to the stormy, grey Chicago days outside was like taking a photo of depression and charging people $400 a night to look at it. No thanks. Waiting for a cab at their cab stand was brutal. We basically had to add 15-20 minutes onto any of our travel times to accommodate the long lines here, and the car service they had was never available at any point from Thursday-Sunday, sooo don't count on trying to save any scratch or be able to take advantage of any of of the perks. The front desk told me that the best way to be able to get a reservation in with them was to come down a half hour before the concierge opens and wait in line to try and get a booking. Uhm, I don't know about you, but getting up and going down to the club atmosphere lobby at 7:30am and waiting in line for 30 minutes to ask for a ride. F*ck that noise. Oh and for the price of the room on weekend, I was expecting a bowling alley in there or something, not just 2 beds, very little room and a bathroom with ZERO privacy that actually has a window you can open to see people on the toilet. Kinky... but not totally my thing. I just don't dig it and I don't know that I ever will.",3,21,11,16

The hotel itself counts with a great swimming pool, excellent fitness facilities and a great restaurant in the lobby. While most of front desk's staff is very friendly, there were occasions that I had to deal with arrogant ones, as if we were doing a favor in staying at the hotel. One last reason for not receiving a five-star is that, on some occasions that I had stayed there, the floor of the room would be wet or the internet would be extremely slow that I would just give up using it altogether. All in all, it is a great hotel. With its brand, we would expect nothing but perfection. That is why, a five-star is not granted just yet.",4,2,0,0

2992,KZPXFD-Db0XGgVta97Nzrg,"The location and the atmosphere of the hotel is nice,  The rooms were comfy and great view. However, the service is absolutely awful and unacceptable.It was hectic and chaotic and not what we would expect from a 4-star hotel, let alone the W. I am a frequent patron of the Starwood Family and this was absolutely dis-concerning. The concierges didn't even know the area, nor were they friendly or helpful. And when I finally dragged out of them a recommendation, it was probably the worst meal we ever had. He basically googled the restaurant that was closest to where we were going. Unacceptable.     The Acura car was never available and the spa was not enjoyable. The bar-tending staff was rude and slow. The elevator took forever and in a elevator conversation with another guest, they initiated the conversation on how disappointing this hotel was and chaotic and relaxing.

2993,jJzUEbNzqMG3knGxjLrj1A,"I'm definitely a fan of W Hotels, but I can't say this location is one of my fav's!  As other's have mentioned, the retro-fit was poorly done and it's especially noticeable when it comes to their heating or air-conditioning.  The rooms have a tough time keeping a consistent temperature, and the hallways are either overly warm or overly cold.  Tough to find common ground. The bright side is, service doesn't get much better.  There's nothing this hotel won't do to help make your stay more enjoyable.  From great restaurant recommendations to driving you in the Acura Experience.  (which btw, is very common among W Hotels). So it's really a toss up for me....the the prices the command, I really don't believe there's room for imperfection.  As a matter of fact, try ordering a bottle to the room, and you'll probably fall off your chair - $250 bottle, $3.50 delivery, $51 bottle service, and $26 tax....WTF!!!!   are you serious!!!??? As for location, there's a great lake view, you're right by Navy Pier, and you're about 3 blocks (long blocks though) from Michigan (Magnificent Mile).  So while I'd agree there isn't all that much within the immediate block of this hotel, there are many options if you walk a few blocks. It's a toss up for me....but I think they'll have trouble getting my business again.....too many choices in the great City of Chicago to be paying top dollar and receive sub-par value.  Just my opinion.",3,1,1,0

2995,r3F,"W hotels and ""child-friendly"" are two terms that don't normally go together.  Usually, the trendy euro vibe, techno music and stylish bar/lounge make it the kind of place that parents used to go to. However, this W is different.  The location next to Navy Pier and all of the child-friendly parks and activities in the neighborhood mean that parents with young kids flock here, especially on a holiday weekend.   The hotel itself seems to have an identity crisis about this. Others have mentioned the poor use of the rooftop - the event-only space that apparently used to be a great restaurant.  On the pool level, a great outdoor patio overlooking Ohio St Beach and Lake Michigan is poorly utilized with a small, lonely bar and a few high tables. Where are the lounge chairs and the music that would give it a Rio or Miami-style vibe? Instead, with a small grill serving hot dogs and burgers, it had a family cookout feel, and it shut down around 8 (perhaps because the kids needed to get to bed). Speaking of kid-friendly areas, the pool area has no hot tub, but comes with pool toys so that the young ones can have fun.  It's also difficult to get food and drink service there (apparently you have to pay a 20% service charge and a delivery fee if you want anything other than the kid friendly food and limited bar on the patio.) One more gripe - in the morning, hot water was iffy in the shower - maybe it's tough to get it all the way up to the 32 floor. With all that said, since I wasn't traveling with kids, you may wonder why this place gets 3 stars? The answer? The view from a room on a high floor is downright breathtaking - get a room with a lake view if at all possible. The view can stand toe-to-toe with any ocean view on a sunny day, and is well worth seeing for yourself. The room was laid out so that you could see the view from everywhere (including the shower). The peaceful beauty of it might even help soothe you after a day with the kids. If the W starts a family-friendly line, this might be ground zero. But for the single partiers, guys/ladies nights out or young couples, I say go for the other W - City Center. For families and those that love a nice view, come on over - you won't be alone.",3,1,0,0
2996,hQDOiV-HjEB1XhChjzR2iA,"This W has a fair amount of pros and cons for me. Pros - great views of Lake Michigan, clean rooms, fresh baked chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon, Fonte coffee in the morning, very helpful concierge, decent sized gym. Cons - Not ideal for business travel since it is kinda far from everything business (and also a hike from the El), very poor a/c in the lobby/common areas/elevators.  I was there this past week when it was in the mid-90's and it was absolutely unbearable outside of the actual guest room. There is a nice lobby bar, which gets a decent amount of action at night but other than that, there is not too much within a short walking distance of this W.  On the other hand, cabs are easily accessible.",3,0,0,0

We headed to Chicago for a smaller family vacation, only taking us an hour to get from the northern suburbs to Chicago, Perfect location!! The also give you Bliss prouducts, which smell very good. Now onto the bad side.... We found cut toenails on the floor of our hotel, I was thinking maybe even the cleaning ladies didn't want to clean it up so they left it there. That was on our first night so we were not pleased. They charge you for calling out of your room, and DOWN THE STREET. not happy about that either.

2998,1PdpMpoD6yEYIrCnFmLSYQ,"A solid hotel, near Navy Pier. Good for business during the week, and a happening nightspot on the weekends (anticipate Vegas style noise from the drunks in the hallways Friday and Saturday nights). The bar had the usual mix of great bartenders and crappy, unattentive ones. If I recall, Mich Ultras we're $6 bucks, which seems kinda high, even for Chicago. We were there at the same time as an instagram party, which meant we got some gratis apps, and watched as people attempted to look more important than they really were, a la Hollywood style. The hotel room itself was nice, clean, everything as it should be, though as with many of the W chain, the bathroom is not sealed, rather has plantain shutters between the toilet and the bed...which when paired with the lack of a vent fan, can be awkward for a romantic weekend. The gym was small, yet well appointed. Wifi is free in the lobby...but they try to make you pay in the rooms. No surprises here.",4,1,1,1

Three reasons it wasnt a 5: - the location has a great view, but it is a little bit farther from the real mix of River North. I found myself in cabs more than I usually do in Chicago (though cabs are cheap and easy to get) - House cleaning is slow. If I leave at 830 and come back at 415- I expect my room to be cleaned. It wasnt - twice in 5 days. Not good enough. - I used their house dry cleaning service to clean and press a suit. The prices on the dry cleaning were what you'd expect from an in house luxury hotel service. The issue? I had a small split by one seam of my suit pants. SMALL. Asked if they could repair it (i could have with a needle and thread) and they said yes. They did, for $61! Sixty one dollars? Give me a break. $10 is standard, so $20 would have been standard for a hotel. They also just did it, and didnt tell me how much it would be. I was floored. None the less, I will stay here again.

We were told we could fit our 150 guests but just didn't feel like it would work. And we would have needed to invest in a lot of rentals (linens, chair covers, and draperies) to brighten up the space to fit our look/feel.

3004,QyZQpwn6t31pOg9SSyO13Q,"First time staying @ a W and if they are all like this one, probably the last. Booked a 2 night stay here over the holidays to take advantage of their indoor pool and take the family out to downtown restaurants for a change. The room was tiny and so was the bathroom.  Unlike the Renaissance on Wacker which has 2 queen size beds and plenty of room, this place can only squeeze in two doubles and barely leave enough room to move around.  It's so bad, that they do not even have a luggage rack: no place to put it.  So basically you put your suitcase on a shelf just below where all your clothes would hand in their wall mounted organizer. The bathroom also lacks a real door.  We had a sliding bamboo door and shutters. I shit you not!  There are wooden shutters in a wall separating the main room from the bathroom. Front desk service here is a hit or miss as well.  Checking in, I said I did not have my Starwood card with me.  In most places they volunteer to look it up or provide some guidance to earn points after the fact.  Not here, she just ignored me.  Not a big deal, as I seldom stay @ Starwood properties; prefer Marriott and Hilton brands.

They always have room rates which includes valet parking ($53/night with in/out privileges) and 2 free drinks at the lobby bar (and it's not just well drinks. They do include top shelf). Room: Very clean. There is a day-bed looking furniture for lounging. The desk area isn't my favorite as it's not quite functional.. but if I was travelling for pleasure, it wouldn't matter much to me. They do offer 500 SPG points for foregoing daily cleaning service.  Internet costs $.  Also- there is an open panel between the bedroom and the bathroom. You can get your privacy by closing the wooden shutters. It's visual proof, but not soundproof. If you're there with someone you're not too comfortable with, you might want to look for another hotel. Business center: it's called ""wired""... It costs $$ just to sign onto a computer. Printing service also costs $$... Not ideal... Lobby bar: staff is okay. About $14 for johnnie walker black, plus $2 for ice! I find it ridiculous... but thanks to my free drink vouchers, I only had to pay gratuity. Lobby restaurant: Limited menu with small plates.

Front Desk staff with exceptionally welcoming attitude, demeanor, and helpfulness. +1 for being able and willing to accommodate and change my rooms when I found loud air conditioners or neighbours with barking dogs upon arrival. +1 again for being able and willing to work with me when I needed to cut short my stay due to a hurricane bearing down on my home.

Word to the wise it can get quite packed on weekend nights, so go a little early. The hotel its self is not too bad. Good views over all.  Great guest service. Bliss soaps, shampoos and lotions in the bathroom. Its also a great way of trying out Bliss products instead of shelling out the 30 plus bucks. I am not a big fan of the whole wooden window thing that seperates it from the room. Couldn't they just use frosted glass like aloft??? Overall, the rooms are good. There is a pool upstairs, but it is small and not heated in the winter...bburrr!!! The W also has a bar on their top floors. Before it used to be open to who ever, but now you must present a key to get up there. Nice for their guests safety. Since it is now just for guests, the bar can be a hit or miss with the crowd and music. Recap: Bar upstairs (meh) + hotel room and stay (good) + lobby bar (good)= we will give you a 3",3,1,3,1

The W Chicago - Lakeshore is another great property.  Service is tip top - and that is what is important.  Check-in is always a breeze, everyone always offering to help.  Going to the Bliss Spa is a great way to spend an afternoon.  And having a drink in the Living Room people watching is a great activity. I ordered room service on a Saturday night from my iPhone using the W Hotel App, and the meals were delivered so fast I thought at first this must be an order for another room.  (Use the W app - great to get things sent up to your room right away!) Like most W's, the hotel was a rehab project - i remember staying in this hotel when it was a Days Inn many moons ago.  The ""shutters"" in the bathroom take some getting used to if you have not seen them previously, but it adds to the quirkiness that I love about this place.  The beds are great to sleep in - great view of Lake Michigan - a great pool on the 8th floor - I could go on and on and on. It is a great location.  But note folks - this is a W - make sure you do your homework and understand what a W hotel is like.  Whimsical.  Whatever.  Whenever.  This isn't a stuffy old traditional property - the Ws have a theme and attitude that I am guessing many of the other reviewers misunderstood...",5,0,0,0

Other than that, the rooms are stylish and relaxing. You can have a city view with Sears Tower or the Navy Pier and Lake Michigan. They have complimentary cookies, water, and apples in the lobby and you can sign up to use an Acura if you need to get around town.

3031,Fg2arhBlGmzaBqQYYjxRzQ,"Quite honestly, I didn't really expect to be giving this place 5 stars after our first impression.   1)  The front drop off is very poorly designed.  You'd think the cabbies would get the hang of it since they probably drop people off all the time, but the valets/parking director guys had to constantly redirect people who pulled in the wrong way.  I'm sure this gets very frustrating for them...in fact it's quite obvious it does, because the valets tend to yell at everyone who drives in.  Hopefully not at guests pulling in, but I only experienced it with the two or three cab rides we took back to the hotel. 2)  The girl who checked us in was pretty rude.   3)  It WAS pretty obvious upon entering our room that it had been remodeled from a significantly crappier room...the popcorn ceiling was still there.  Also there wasn't a lot of room for storage. 4)  $52/night parking?!?! But after that initial impression, things were looking up.   1)  I loved the ""Good Morning/Good Afternoon/Good Evening"" mats they diligently changed out in the elevators every day.   2)  I loved the view and location.   3)  I loved the gym (and the view from the gym!)  And the apples. 4)  I loved the stealhy ninja cleaning ladies who managed to find windows to get our room nice and tidy even if we were only gone for like 30 minutes.   5)  I loved the Bliss bath products 6)  I ESPECIALLY loved the concierge who helped us when we had a medical emergency late Sunday night.  I never did get his name but he had longish curly hair and made it a priority to ensure that we were taken care of.  He got us in touch with medical staff on call, and when even they couldn't help us, he called around to get us an emergency appointment first thing the next morning.  He was a lifesaver!!! Yes, it got a little crowded and loud in the lobby/bar/restaurant in the evenings, but it didn't bother us at all.  I was bummed that I don't get SPG points if I book through Priceline, but I got a waaaaay better rate that way so I guess it worked out.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",5,2,1,0

And the room itself was terrific - king-size bed, a plasma tv, nice modern accents, and slick shower, complete with Bliss Spa bath products. I had wake-up calls scheduled each morning I was in town, and the person who called each time was soothing and polite, so a nice way to start each day. Oh, when I did get to my room, about 20 minutes into it, Jen called to inquire if I needed anything. I actually didn't get a chance to really enjoy the bar but it seems more of a scene at happy hour than at night, but that could have been because I was there on a Wednesday and Thursday. Still, as with all the Ws I've been to around the US, the bar and lounge were typically sleek and playful, sort of like something out of a Jonathan Adler catalog. Since I took cabs (always plentiful outside), I didn't get to really explore the walking area around the hotel, so I can't comment on location, save for the fact that wherever I went around town, my fare was always under $10. All in all, I'd easily recommend this W for a stay, whether you're a tourist or business traveler, heck even a weary local who wants a bit of style and fun.

3033,AA7wrvIZghHdgfCvu-faCg,"An occasional perk of having gainfully employed friends is the occasional business trip to Chicago. Another perk is dinner on them and a chance to inspect swanky hotels (and every now and again, the inspection turns into a mini-bar/chick flick slumber party). Such was the case in this... um...case. There are a few things to know about this particular W. It's hip. Bumpin' hip. Sparkly top hip. The design choices while interesting, are maybe not the most functional. For instance, the shower is half enclosed by glass with no door so you get a wet floor unless you put a towel down. Also, there's a window on the wall that separates the bathroom and the bedroom which is only closed by wooden shutters (as is the door). If you happen to be staying with someone you're not, say, very comfortable with, you may find it difficult to.... well... shy kidneys, ok? Don't make me say it. The flat screen tv is great, the in-house DVD and iPod players are excellent touches and every room encourages a visit to the sky bar with a free drink card (hello, Mr. Blueberry Mojito). The space is gorgeous, with fresh flowers everywhere that scent the lobby remarkably well. The indoor pool is housed in a space which is a bit dark, but is adjacent to a lovely teak-floored outdoor patio with chaise lounges and a lovely view of the Lake. The rooms are small and the popcorn ceiling was really bugging me given the other fancy pants elements (too picky?). My friend is a platinum member and requested a 4pm check out for me so I could sleep in, however at 8am housekeeping knocked and attempted the door (twice).

The design of the hotel is cool and contemporary (browns/lavendars/grays), very West Elm-ish. We asked for a room on a higher floor, which they accommodated, but the view was not of the lake or Navy Pier. Night view was nice because during the holidays, Chicago decorates streets with lights, but during the day, the view is of  other people's condos and parking lot. We had 1 window instead of 5. I was most impressed with the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and liquid facial soap from Bliss (famous brand for spa located in NY, Chicago and LA -- probably elsewhere too). Really liked the quality of shampoo and conditioner. But, we didn't get bar soap to wash hands (but they do have soap dish). I had to use facial liquid soap just to wash hands (slight inconvenience). No bathtub either (not that I wanted to take a bath or anything). Shower was nice, but Swissotel offered both. The bathroom shelf where Bliss products looked mildly dusty [ : \ ] The ""W"" experience was more about selling stuff. They had Bruce Mau book on spectators and a ""W"" book that sells brands and products. Cover was kind of cool (looks like fishnet), but book looked kind of old. I flipped through it anyways. I did like how they labelled the price for water ($6 for Fuji water). So if you are a hipster, this hotel might be for you, but I prefer to pay and extra $20 for Swissotel.

Rushed renovation or bad maintenance? As I mentioned before, the customer service here is excellent!. As was the food in the restaurant. I think it's called Wave. Anyhow, the staff at Bliss were also very nice and extremely accommodating. I would stay here again just for that. On the flip-side, who would want to stay in a nice hotel with bad service?

I dunno..the W was cool back in the early  early 2000's... there are far more cooler, nicer, hipper, newer hotels in Chicago  I'd stay before here.  And the hallways were dark and dingy.

Lots of glitz and glamor, lots of hip and trendy-looking architecture and amenities (showers without doors, flat-screen TV's, etc.); but overall the service was no better than comparable hotel chains. The best feature of this hotel is its location. The views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier are spectacular. W Hotels seem to attract a certain clientele. Young, ""hip,"" narcissistic, club-hopping Gen Y alcoholics. To be fair, it may have been this location, but I felt like I was at a meat market. Plus, I was awakened at 3:00am one night by a large and loud group of people looking to ""continue the party"" in someone's room next door to me. So if you just need a place to stay during business meetings, this W isn't worth all the pretentiousness. Any of the Kimpton hotels in the area offer much better value (and much better personal service) for the price. But if hip and trendy is important, if you want to see and be seen, W could be for you.

I'll keep it short and sweet. I travel on a weekly basis for work and pleasure, have stayed in both fantastic and terrible hotels around the world.

Customer service is most important, and non-existent at this establishment (as pointed out by previous Yelpers).

The staff here is great and they really try to take care of you while you are staying here. The rooms are nice - and if you get a lakeview room the view is pretty amazing.  The odd thing is with all the windows open in your room while you are taking a shower you can look at the view at the same time!

In the meantime, I had a massage at the Bliss Spa on the upper floor, which was very nice. When I finally got to the room, it was nice and warm and had new-age chill-out music playing. Did I mention that this new-age chill-out music plays everywhere , 24/7 at the W? It can become more grating than calming. The room had a great view, the beds were comfy and the bathroom was cool and well stocked with Bliss spa products. Had I been staying with multiple people the shuttered window to the bathroom might not have given enough privacy.

I'd originally reserved a room elsewhere, but a reservation mixup with Expedia landed me here - and in hindsight, I couldn't have been more lucky! The hotel itself feels more like a hipster lounge than a hotel. Upon entering the lobby, you will be greeted by smiling faces set in an ultra-chic club room of sorts, complete with dark wood and metallic tile materials, falling water and fresh baskets of apples (a part of the W founder's tradition). The entire hotel smells of a light, almost floral cologne - it's delightful. Soft house (read: electronic) music flows and adds to the air of ""cool"". The room we stayed in was not terribly spacious, but it was satisfactory enough. A great view of the lake combined with W's legendary matresses made for a fine stay. My wakeup call I had scheduled the night before even included a recommendation to bring my sunglasses, as it was quite a sunny day. The Bliss Spa is also a luxurious indulgence, I received an awesome manicure there. At night, the lobby turns into a full-fledged lounge, complete with cocktails, cool furniture, a bar and a DJ. Very cool! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the W. Extremely comfortable beds, helpful courteous staff in an ultra-hip environment is the name of the game.

The downsides, not enough elevators!  On Saturday night becuase of the club on 33rd floor we could not get back to room for 15 minutes. Service while good just feels false, almost too good.  Did not appreciate being charged to have packages delivered to the room, seemed cheap for a hotel in this price range. I know that I am not the target age group for their marketing, but plenty of people my age visit this hotel and I would love them to first turn down the elevator music and then have someone ease off on the bass and drum beats early in the morning.

Since I live in the city, I only stayed over one of the three nights, but I spent the better part of those days in the W and it was quite nice. The first night's event was at Altitude which is the open space at the 33rd floor... The room is all windows with an astounding view of the lake as well as the city.  The ceiling was a little low, but again- the view made up for any nit-picky short comings. Even the elevator is a delight...or a party. It always smelled lovely in the elevator, which you don't realize how nice that is until you're crammed in with a flock of tourists... The elevator music was not your typical sleepy tunes- they were playing Peter, Bjorn & John and other hip anthems. The food was catered by the W and it was good. Not great, but really decent considering they were feeding more than 300 people. On the final night, I stayed over and the room was terrific. I probably had one of the few bad views (looking right out to a cement wall) but even that didn't take away from the overall pleasure of staying there. The bed was possibly as comfy, if not more, than mine at home, and the dcor, while sort of cheesily-trendy, was very comfortable. Also- no generic combined shampoo/conditioner and dry smelly soap...

The lobby is gorgeous, and has a relaxing atmosphere. Checking in was pretty easy. The woman at the front desk was very eager to answer any and all questions we had about our stay. Now for the bad. The room we were provided with was absolute junk. The door to the room would not shut unless two people applied their entire body weight to it. The same goes for the bathroom ""door."" It is made of some sort of mock-bamboo material, and ours just did not want to close, even when the two of us tried. At first glance, the bathroom itself looks very nice. However, it gets about one star from me, because there is no functionality to it what so ever. The ""bamboo"" shutters is by far the worst thing about the room as a whole. You have the ability to shut them, but that does not mask any sounds coming from the bathroom. I love my fiance, but not enough to listen to his every move while using the toilet. The bed sheets in this room were filthy. Stains of God knows what were all over the place when we attempted to take a nap before heading out on the town. That is when we had enough. We requested a different room at the front desk, and were given one with no hassle at all. The door to the new room was completely functional, as was the one to the bathroom. However, there were cracks in the ceiling and while we were sleeping, bits of plaster would fall on to our faces. The temperature of the room is almost impossible to get right, you are either freezing cold, or sweating through your clothes. The shower was horrible in both rooms. Very pretty looking, but when in use, it gets water all over the floor since there is only half of a ""door"" and no curtain. The knob on our shower was also broken, so it took about 15 minutes for us to turn it on. All in all, the W was beautiful on the outside, but for what you are paying, it is definitely not worth it.

Bartender.  The upstairs bartender was possibly the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.   Bad: Pretentious.  Pretentious.  Pretentious.  They turn the lobby into a mock night club with a live DJ at night.  If you're not wearing clothes they consider appropriate, you'll be asked to leave.  Its a god damned hotel lobby?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?  As a guest, I should not feel awkward about being in the lobby of the hotel I'm staying at.  Not only that, but the bouncer was incredibly rude about it.  Saying anything like, ""We get sports and movie stars in here all the time and they can't wear their hats either."" is not cool what so ever.  You're a bouncer.  . . GFY. Generally the staff did not look interested in being helpful and had more important things to do than express interest looking after this guest.  Don't judge a book by its cover people. . . Funny Anecdote- As I was leaving, I noticed a huge tour bus parked outside.  I didn't think anything of it until I got a call from my buddy.  Apparently I was leaving just as Snoop and 50 Cent were on their way in.  If I had known that, I would have stayed another night. . .

3093,acebit3QGPRW1gD-VoqFCg,"I attended a corporate event here and had a good time. However, the prices should NOT just be about location. The W seems to be an old, rundown hotel they took and tried to gussy up. My friends' room had scuff marks on the walls, cheap wood (or press board?) paneling nailed to one wall, and it was TINY. The bathrooms have a window, which is not only weird, but provide NO sound barrier. Pretty awkward, depending on who you're staying with. The shower heads are low and her husband almost wasn't able to fit under them! The bamboo blinds were also filthy. When you enter the room, you are greeted with a basket of goodies. Wow! Now, this helps to explain the $300ish for a crap room rates... or maybe not. We soon realized that next to this basket of ""goodies"" was a price list. An individual can of Pringles? $5! You can also buy 3 or 4 condoms for $12 and a ""Take me Away"" CD for $13. Wow. sexy, huh? Not really. Oh- and if you want anything that isn't in your room (towels, food, etc.) it's a $3.50 DELIVERY CHARGE and a 20% service fee. Wow. The 33rd floor (I believe it's called the Altitude Room?) is pretty nice, but the bathrooms have no main door. Again... awkward. The stones in the sink were pretty cool though, I have to admit. I would never, EVER pay to stay here, but people seem to like it. I guess when you have money to throw into the air at mediocre service and rooms, it's worth it.",2,0,0,0

3095,CnxgFwN5KosWByOaJoAcag,"What a disappointment.  I recently became a Starwoods Reward Club member, so rather than stay at the Palmer House Hilton the way I usually do when I'm in Chicago, I decided to scout this place out instead.   It was raining miserably during the time I was here, so I didn't venture out around the property, but here are some observations about the hotel itself. High Points: *The concierge has a list of restaurants that will deliver to the hotel.  This is an excellent feature because room service for dinner is rather awful (see low points below). *The room itself is very comfortable and clean. *I lost an earring.  Housekeeping found it and placed it where I would see it.  I was very pleased. *They have a nice facility for a gym *They have an Acura car service that will take you around the city for free, as long as you sit through a 1 minute video on your ride and listen to the driver talk about the car and fill out a short survey.  (Service is available from noon-7pm only.) *Navy Pier looks like its in walking distance.  I could see it was close from a hotel window. Low Points: *Hotel room service is bad and expensive!.  I had the chicken pot pie for dinner which was just gross.  It was a lardy mess and not really a pie at all with the tiniest pieces of chicken and veggies almost like the kind that you would find in a can of condensed soup.  I also ordered a $12 slice of carrot cake, which for the price I hoped would be amazing and it was small and just 'meh bordering on not good.   *The shower kept changing temperature!!!  I took two showers while I was there, one long and one short (I know, TMI huh?). During the long shower the water temperature got cold at least 5 or 6 times.  And during the short shower at least a couple of times.  That is just plain old unacceptable! *They have a popular happy hour.  That in and of itself is a good thing, however, the bar is right next to the reception desk.  The music and crowd was so loud that I could not hear the front desk staff as I was checking in. *I got a double room when I asked for a King. * The hallways are noisy in the evenings, sounded like hotel staff. Other points: *They have a very interesting menu option: fresh fruit with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and......a disposable camera.  Enjoy! :)",2,1,0,2
3096,fbGzM81X,"There were a lot of hotels I wanted to stay at in Chicago and finally decided with W @ Lakeshore. Great hotel, when I come back, I'll be here again. Intimate, plus and private. Love the minimalist designing of the hotel (and all W hotels). Book the hotel if...: if are young or ""feel younger"", into or somewhat into ""urban chic"", and you are plan to take advantage of the hotel's offerings. To book the room isn't that expensive but to take advantage of what the hotel offers, is. For example, their Whenever Wherever policy - you can basically get whatever you want, when you want it (like White Castle burgers at 3am delivered to you by the hotel staff). Rooms: made for couples. Don't plan on coming here with your family or if you do, get separate rooms. For example, there is no bathroom door. Rather, it is a sliding wood door that it not on rails (it's a ""casual-optional"" door and there is a wooden window from the bathroom to the bedroom that is meant to be kept open. LCD's in every room, minibar has everything you want from food to booze to hats to ""love packages"" (condoms, lube, mints and some other stuff). The toiletries are from Bliss so yeah, actual name brand stuff unlike most hotels since most top hotels have their ""exclusive"" brands but they don't mean anything because the dealer only deals to them; so it's actually generic). If you're crazy about spa, they have the Bliss spa experience. They have a great pool (indoor of course); it's open to all hotel guests so no need to do the spa if you don't want. They have a club/bar upstairs that has an AWESOME view of Chicago. If you're a hotel guest, just flash your card since there will be a line to get in on weekends. If you want feel pampered (and you are willing to spend the money for it), you  will have a great time here. You can also be discreet to and enjoy all the amenities. Friendly and very-knowing concierge desk. Since it's at Lakeshore, this part of the city is relatively quiet compared to the inner-city. Even with the lounge downstairs and club upstairs, you won't hear anything in your room if you want peace and quiet.",4,0,0,0

I checked in right after the Horrible Apocalyptic Tornado Thunderstorms of '07 that had evacuated O'Hare's control tower, brought flights to a standstill, etc. and there was a chance I wouldn't be able to get in to check into my room.  So I called the W in advance and asked about the situation, and they were remarkably pleasant and accommodating: ""We won't charge you if there are acts of God involved!""  Turns out I did get in, albeit around 1 AM, but the front desk team was still equally on top of things.

3112,6NyY8p3VOXC,"I was blown away by the negative reviews that this hotel has.   Yes, it was previously a Days Inn that just happened to be situated in between the prettiest waterfront in town AND the magnificent mile.  Yes, the glitter wall with the giant W at the driveway (which was very poorly designed, by the way) was very tacky, as were the (skankily dressed) non-hotel guests and visitors of the Living Room who loitered around the reception area on Friday and Saturday nights, making it almost impossible to navigate through the crowd and into the bank of elevators. As a side note - the vibe that I got from the lobby is very similar to that of the V Bar at Hotel Valencia, and the skankily dressed non-hotel guests and visitors remind me of San Jose's Santana Row's clientele: cougars on the prowl and 50-y.o dudes with 20-y.o golddigging arm candies.  Nothing beats the feel of home when you are a few thousand miles away. And I do think the attempt to put a ""W"" on anything and everything was a tad overdone.   But in all fairness, they did a good job transforming a dying and derelict Days Inn into a hip hangout joint. The cacophony stopped right there in the lobby.  I got the peace and quiet that I wanted in my room on level 20th, with an amazing view of the frosty Lake Michigan and Navy Pier.  The bed was comfortable (although the odd-looking soft black furry cube soon found its place on the floor), the toiletries are from the phenomenal Bliss Spa, and there was lots and lots of natural light.  I even like the window to the bathroom - although I don't know if I'd feel the same way if I wasn't traveling alone, since I'm not much of an exhibitionist. The service was consistently satisfactory.  Need a dental kit? Done - someone was already at the front door with an assortment of toothpaste / toothbrush / dental floss / mouthwash within 5 minutes.  Need a late check out?

W has gotta decide whether to be a club or a hotel, i think. after getting thru the party line (excuse me, pardon me, sorry) i finally reach the front desk for a quick check-in, no problem. but it is still really odd to have partygoers checking you out while you're simply trying to check-in ... a bit disconcerting. had i known, i might have dressed for the check-in?!?

3122,90JfxNVNkn3BYQTXf5C-xw,"Ugh. I will never stay at this hotel again. I am the one who picked the W in the first place, so I'll take the blame. It looks so plush and stylish in the photos. The first thing we noticed when walking in (besides Billy Zane getting into a limo... now I know it was an omen) was a club atmosphere in the lobby. There were lots of martini drinkers sitting around in sunglasses... The receptionists were too trendy for their own good, and I suspect that the one on the right was faking his English accent. (Oh yeah, they actually tell you to ""take the lift"" here...) In my opinion, it always is a mistake for a hotel staff to come off as condescending, and here, they definitely did. (There are plenty of high-end hotels who operate with friendliness.) We reserved a room with two queen beds, since my sister-in-law was joining us for a couple of days. We got off the elevator (which was scented, a nice touch) and, despite it being full daylight outside, were plunged into club-style darkness. The halls are very dark, with colored lights to guide your walk. When we opened our door, a lot of light was coming in from the big window. (We were on the west side of the hotel, so we had a crappy view of the building next door.) Ambient club music was playing from the small CD alarm clock, and the room looked really clean. Another look, and I realized there were Ws on everything... everything. My God, the room was one big marketing campaign and attempt to sell merchandise (including a $22 bottle of water that had been picked up and passed over so many times the logo had worn off). It was highly annoying to me. I started obsessing about finding everything that was W-branded -- and my finds included a teddy bear, the CD of music playing when we came in, coffee mugs, t-shirts -- and started seeing a lot of wear-and-tear on the room and furniture. Actually, it reminded me a lot of Design on a Dime... like it might look good to last through the photo/filming session, then all the cheap Scandinavian-style laminate furniture and other cost-cutting features start to fall apart and reveal the hotel for what it really is: the illusion of luxury and exclusivity. The most annoying thing, though, was the ""divider"" (yes, I said divider) between the bathroom and rest of the room. There was no solid, latching door, just a woven sliding panel that made comfortable privacy impossible. To boot, the panel in our room was BROKEN, so there was a hole in it. Also, there is a shuttered pass-through between the bathroom and bed area that doesn't fully close off any view or sound. I understand the concept (you can be in bed AND watch your lover take a shower... although the shower curtain was opaque, so I'm not sure what else you could watch), but when a room has two beds, there should be some consideration that lovers might not constitute a full party staying in a room. Not be be crass, but... there's this book called Everyone Poops. I think the W got confused and thought it was called Everyone Needs to Know When Everyone Poops. I give two stars for the beds being comfortable and room service (when requesting towels) being very prompt. Plus, we didn't get robbed... except for our dignity.",2,3,0,0
3123,j96xGJ0dfAAxlda7uWJW6Q,After having to stay in the chicago suburbs I finally got the chance to stay downtown and was excited to stay here - I usually love W's.  This place sucked.  The staff was snotty. The rooms were small.  And the air conditioning was broken or something - it was so hot and muggy.  The place was packed with snotty 20-somethings.   I will say its a great view.  Next time I'll stay closer to MIchigan - likely the Peninsula.,1,0,0,0
3124,EjbpPiSgsaWfU9GknKTzFw,"Let me preface this 2-star review with the following: If this was any other regular hotel, it'd be 3 stars. But, this is the W, and I expected a lot more out of you! There were some redeeming qualities...awesome Bliss toiletries (though on day 1 I was missing conditioner and lotion), great location (close to everything without being directly on Michigan), comfy beds. BUT...There were many problems. This is a Chicago hotel! Do the words ""form follows function"" mean anything to you people?! In W's attempt to make-over the Days Inn, common sense really went out the window. For starters, the bathroom?! WTF? if you want any privacy in your bathroom, don't stay here. Seriously, a sliding wood door with slits, and a ""what the hell is it doing here"" window cut-out with wooden shutters? No overhead fan? A shower without a full door? I had to use a towel just to keep the floor from being completely soaked. Also, no closet, just some shelving. While nice-looking, it was inefficient. It was weird putting my shoes in a drawer. The shelf for my suitcase is directly under the hangers, so when I go into my suitcase, I have clothes hanging, literally, in my face. Annoying. Also, there were some little things that, again at any other hotel wouldn't have been a big deal, but this is the W! For example, both mornings the free coffee was empty. Refilling involved me talking to 2 different people. Lobby (excuse me, ""Living Room"") is way too small for the traffic. Despite 5 stations for front desk clerks, I never saw more than 1 or 2 which resulted in long lines and a crowded lobby. Also, it's hard to forget this was a Days Inn...ugly-colored walls, ,and a ""This used to be a cheap hotel"" stench that just wouldn't go away. If you're going to drop a lot of money on a fancy Chicago hotel, I'd advise looking at other properties. If you want that ""W Experience"" try one in a different city. But, if you can get a good deal, and don't come expecting much, by all means stay here!  When you book your room, request a lake view.",2,2,1,1

The lounge on the first floor was non existent, and the hotel restaurant was a bit difficult to differentiate from the bar/ common area. Oddly enough I was put into room 911 and upon entering the room, the first thing that caught my eye was the window with shutters in the bathroom to the beds. That was a bit weird, but whatever floats your boat. Checked out the pool and gym on the 7th floor, which was pretty standard, but the bar on the roof was nothing to really write home about. Overall the hotel was fairly standard and the staff was very courteous and helpful whenever I needed anything.",3,2,2,0

The only area where the W Lakeshore fell short was the frat boy clientele that invaded the place on Friday night.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed my stay here and the location simply cannot be beat -- very central and the only hotel in Chicago that is actually right on Lake Shore Drive.

3134,HJtST4UMYL9SBi8rPra0Uw,"I am semi cross posting this with my review for the hotel's restaurant, Wave's, since the major issue of hotel security affects those staying at the hotel as well as dining here. I was recently robbed in the restaurant in the hotel's lobby.  My purse was tucked between my feet under the chair/table, and at some point during the meal, it was stolen.  We later realized that there was a man sitting behind me who had turned his chair around and leaned towards us, and we believe he used his foot or some kind of implement to drag my purse out from under the table unnoticed.  Pretty ridiculous, right?  This is the sort of thing that takes practice.   The hotel management was unhelpful to the point of being actively combative when I reported the theft.  I immediately filed a police report and was met with rudeness and a complete lack of assistance from any of the hotel management.  The security guard especially was purposefully rude, and when I complained about the treatment, as the victim of a crime, to the manager, all he would say was, ""I have no control over the behavior of the security team.""  Um, you are the manager of the hotel, and that does not make any sense.  We eventually got the security manager of the W City Center on the phone, who apologized profusely and began to actually help us, including taking down a description of the suspect from the people who had sat across from me and letting me know how to file a formal complaint with the hotel, which the hotel manager had completely neglected to do.  Even in a less trying situation, this customer service would have been unacceptable, but after being robbed in the hotel, in what now turns out to be a repeated occurrence, it became downright offensive.  It's too bad, because I had been a big fan of W properties, but I would never, ever come back to this restaurant OR hotel again.  Potential future visitors, consider this your official warning. After reporting this story to friends, I found out about several other women who had the exact same thing happen to them at this restaurant over the past year.  That sounds like a really bad pattern to me.  Since this has happened, the police and my insurance company's private investigator have confirmed that this hotel is a very common spot for robberies in Chicago.  The fact that the management evidently does not take this seriously is a huge problem.",1,4,0,0

3138,ic5JW2onWWHmT3gDIfzNRw,"I recently stayed at the W Lakeshore for a few days and as time progressed I was less and less impressed with the joint. The rooms (and hotel) is pretty modern, but you can tell it was a holiday inn that got converted. Although my room wasn't bad, a friend of mine got stuck with a really crappy room where the wallpaper was peeling off, the shades were broken, and the shower wasn't the rain shower advertised. I had a ""city view"" room and wasn't impressed with the view. Basically it was looking directly into another hotel or office building, and looking down into an alley. Lake view rooms are the way to go. The W however does shine in the attention to detail department. If you are able to focus listening to the techno music in the elevator you would see the floor mats are updated throughout the day to say ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening"", which is something I haven't seen at any other hotel. I attended a wedding on here and the ballroom was converted to a very intimate setting, which was unexpected. The reception was held on the 33rd floor in a nice hall overlooking the lake and city. This was the best part of my stay here. The Whiskey Sky bar on the 33rd floor is dark and small, and drinks are expensive. After one drink in here I had to take off as I couldn't stand being unable to see my hand in front of my face and couldn't move without bumping into someone. Picture being in a walk in closet with the lights off and you'll get the same feel as this place. As others have reported, the lobby doubles as a lounge for the first floor bar at night, so if possible try to avoid this area at night. You won't be able to hear anyone working the counter, and they won't be able to hear you. If you aren't  in 'clubbing' attire you probably will catch a few unwelcoming glances by the older crowd drinking at the bar. Another disappointing  aspect of this joint is the pool on the 7th floor. It leaves much to be desired. Also, don't go into this place looking for a hot tub, because there isn't one to be found. Very surprising for such an expensive place. The gym however looked pretty nice, with free weights, machines, a cardio deck and kettle balls. All in all, if you want to get more bang for your buck, stay somewhere else in the city. If you do find yourself staying here, get a lake view room and hope for good weather so you aren't trapped in a real life version of A Night at the Roxbury.",2,2,0,0
3139,BUfOHdSIAiPV3-NSxPR2BQ,Well...I understand that most W are known to be trendy hot spots for most Chicago locales and tourist but I'm going to have to disappoint many people by saying this W (on Lake Shore Dr.) isn't a place I'd ever recommend. Let me first start off by saying...it use to be a Days Inn. What Starwood did was slap a coat of paint and added some Ikea like bedding. The service...well I'm not sure if people who work at the W know that they are in the service business. For some reason I find that most people who work there think you own them a thank you. The bars...are awful and over priced. I don't like paying 15 dollars for a drink and a bad one too. The bartenders don't seem to know what they are doing. I'll pass on this W.

I arrived rather early and was told that my room was not ready yet, but they would call me my room was ready. Did I mention I was upgraded to one of their Fantastic Suites with a Lake View! SPG Platinum status rocks! I was out when I received a call back from the Welcome Desk (front desk) that my suite was ready. The suite on the 22nd floor overlooked Lake Michigan and Lakeshore Drive. I entered our suite to a large living room and desk. There was a 42"" flat screen television, sirius satellite radio, dvd player, and CD changer. The bedroom was to the left and the master bathroom was off to the side of the bedroom. The bathroom had Bliss bath products. The nice thing about this bathroom was that it had both a shower and a tub. Let me just say the shower was divine.   The bed is also wonderful too. I swear whenever I'm staying at the W it's so so difficult to get out of their plush signature bed. Another nice thing going on at the W's is the Acura experience. So what the heck is the Acura experience. To sum it up W Hotels and Acura have teamed up to offer hotel guests rides in new Acura's within a 3 mile radius of the hotel.

3179,AfVddosd8gUi4QFdiog4ng,"I've now stayed here dozens of times and it seems to be a staple property for my team when we work in Chicago. Overall it's a great property, but the location is a bit inconvenient.  Aside from the proximite to Navy Pier, it's a bit out of the way from the downtown area, or the uptown nightlife. The bar area is very cool with tons of space for people to spread out on a variety of different chairs/couches. On each of the floors, there is a little telescope that allows you to view Navy Pier from an elevated view, which is a nice cool touch. The valet guys are very helpful- they'll waive down cabs that are lined up around the corner of Lakeshore drive.  However, the design of the drop-off/pick-up circle is very odd.  Sometimes you have traffic going in both directions, and in the busy mornings, it's not uncommon to get stuck between a few cars going in different directions.

3188,ZS5WThBFalWLMUjOEuTpFA,"I have stayed at the W (Lakeshore Drive) a handful of times, and I have never been disappointed. The staff is very polite, the rooms are well appointed, and the scene/atmosphere is very young and trendy. One of my favorite aspects of this hotel is a very very small thing, and  is something you might expect from the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton's and Peninsulas of Chicago. The W changes out their elevator rugs three times a day. In the morning it reads, Good Morning, in the afternoon, Good Afternoon, and in the evening, you guessed it, Good Evening. Like I said, this is a very minor detail, but in my opinion, it's the kind of detail that helps justify the price and set  the hotel apart from others. I would like to make a couple comments on some of the reviews I have read on this hotel. In regards to the Silver Wall at the hotels main entrance, I think this is a lot less tacky/gaudy then a lot of other reviewers because I believe it is one, intentional and two, a good fit with the hotels overall theme. I would agree that, if a Four Seasons had this outside of its front doors that yes, it would be tacky, but the W is all about young people having a good time and in my opinion, it works. I also agree with the reviewers who said this is not a family hotel.... not that families are unwelcome, but I would be a little uncomfortable with one of my parents going to the bathroom and/or taking a shower in a bathroom without an actual door. The beds in the rooms are very comfortable. They have that softness that you know you couldn't sleep on every night, but is heaven for a night or two. The gym at the W is not great, but does have enough equipment to get the job done. I have not been to the spa, but I have heard good things. The lobby bar and the Whiskey Bar upstairs (great view) are both great, and get very crowded on the weekends and are an awesome spot to spend your night or stop in for a nightcap before you head to your room. Overall, I like this hotel and will definitely return, if you are looking for a fun hotel to stay at, the W is one of the best choices in Chicago.",4,1,1,0

3192,yfy,"i love spg. i love W. i love THIS W hotel!!! at first i was a bit disappointed that i was not staying at the W hotel downtown and had to settle for the W hotel lakeshore. i've stayed at the one downtown near the sears tower but i think i would actually chose this location instead. if you're into walking, you can walk from one to the other but it is a bit far. the lakeshore location is near the navy pier which you can see from your hotel room. it is also close to the magnificent mile for shopping! for the rooms there are two options: lake view room and city view rooms (self explanatory). the set up for the two is the same essentially, just your view is different. im not in the hotel room long enough to really care. the rooms are spacious. i got a double bed room and the two of us had plenty of room. i love the bliss brand shampoo, conditioner, face wash, bar soap, and lotion they give you! the design of the room almost seemed like you were living in a cabana. there were two door wooden shutters from the bathroom that you can look out into the room. wierd at first b/c you can look into the bathroom but then convenient when you had people in your room and you can socialize while getting ready in the bathroom. this W like all W's are beautiful and modern. it's like you're entering a club 24/7. i stayed over the weekend (fri-sun) and the lobby was busy both nights. when you check-in, they offer you a free drink ticket at that bar!! there were 4 of us in our mid-20s and we wanted to go out and had NO idea were to go.. so one of us asked the concierge where to go and he gave us some suggestion and his card. at first we were hesitant to go b/c we werent sure if they were just selling the place b/c they were getting a commission or if this place was actually good. we first went to a jazz bar which was cool b/c they were playing live music. we didnt stay too long but it was a good experience b/c chicago has such a lively music scene. we then took a taxi to Y club and got in line. the bouncer said the club was closed only to people on the guestline or cover was $20/person. then my friend said that our concierge from the W gave us his card and said we could get in for free. and the bouncer was like ''oooh you're with the W.. go on in"" same thing happened at crescendo! both pretty high scale lounge/clubs. we saved $40/person just by talking to our concierge. if you dont' call that service, i dont konw what is!! also while i was waiting in the lobby for a taxi, a couple walks in with 3 dogs, one about 70lbs the other two about 10lbs. and i spoke to them a bit and they said the westin has a really good dog policy. theres no extra charge, just a deposit in case of any damage. don't know how true that is but if you want to bring your dog along with you, W's are the place to go! anyway, highly recommended. there was a good mix of younger people, as well as families. a little bit of everything for anyone.",5,0,0,0

Nice decor, friendly people, music was great ,a really nice ambiance. Then I went to my room. It was OK I guess. Nothing extravagant but what is up with the bathroom? It has a sliding door that you can't lock and it's made of wood. Then there is a sliding wood window. So if you are squatting to use the bathroom the person outside of the bathroom just slides the window open and peek a boo....they see you! Then it's not like your typical hotel where you will find a bible in the drawer. Nope.... you'll find condoms to purchase and a $13 romantic CD. There is no coffee in the room for your morning coffee. Room service is way overpriced, definitely did not order room service. This hotel is way over prices honestly. I stood there and usually I will park at the hotel and get my ticket validated because I am a guest....nope...$55 when I got my car back for a 24 hour stay. Now lets talk about what happened at night. The elevator door opened at the Lobby at 11:30pm and the smell of weed hit me in the face. There is a lounge/club on the 8th floor that everyone was riding the elevator to get to. It is tiny but yet hundreds of people were going there, way over booked and the people that were going there were all stoned. I guess I had a different impression of this hotel. It is in a classy neighborhood so I did not expect all the craziness that went on that night to be allowed there. I was even surprised when I went to the front desk there were 3 guys chipping in money to get a room. They were putting in $1100.00 for a room, they were arguing because they didn't have enough money and needed to go out to the car to get more. See I didn't even know you can get a room paying cash, I thought a credit card was always required.

Our honeymoon isn't until December so this looked fun. We booked with them and paid ahead of time; we had to do this because of the special we got for two nights. It was a great room overlooking the lake. The food sucked but whatever. A week later I noticed that I had been double charged. So I was now out $1200!!!! yup and I'm a teacher so you know I ain't got no money. The amount we paid ahead was $500 for two nights. Then suddenly we were charged another $700. Eventually it was all taken care of after many phone calls and much frustration. The only reason I'm giving at A-OK is because they offered that we stay there again for free to let us have a better experience.

3978,xyJShZepycBk9N73bebJLw,"I stayed for a 3-day conference at the hotel.  I have stayed in other downtown hotels in NYC, SF, and London - the urban hotel is not a foreign experience. Summary: *  Bed.  Felt like a thin mattress sitting on a wooden board, and angled with feet higher than head; *  Noise.  Room was very poorly insulated from noise.  On the last night, we heard our neighbors arrive after midnight, argue - though only speaking loudly and not screaming - for several hours.  We could make out phrases and words fairly clearly  Additionally, the previous neighbor, we could hear clear words when spoke on the phone; *  Housekeeping cleaning neighbors at 7.30 am.  Given poor noise insulation, this woke me up on Sunday morning.  Not appropriate to be cleaning rooms at 7.30 am, unless some kind of emergency; *  Storage shortage.  No dresser, only few drawers in nightstand.  Heard fellow conference goers complain of the same experience in their rooms, respectively.  Bathroom had a tiny, glass shelf above the toilet and about 4-6"" of flat space next to the sink basin.  Towel bar - only one in the entire bathroom, and two, small, rob hooks; *  Parking.  $52/day!  Really?  Yes, I've paid that amount in Manhattan.  But, it seems steep for Chicago.  Even on Wacker; *  Taxi cab shortage.  On a rainy, Friday night, the cab line took about 30 min.  It was reportedly this way for much of the afternoon / evening.  Really?  If this is the City's largest hotel (as they told us when we checked in), and it positions itself as a premium property, shouldn't it make sense that they'd have relationships with taxi companies to try and get better supply on occasions such as that?  If it's rainy, and a Friday night, there will be city-wide shortage - so, what's the contingency plan for your hotel patrons?; *  Gym.  Finding the gym was a work out.  In the basement and down a fairly long hall, and past grandma's house did I go.  Not central to the room areas;  and *  Lighting in large meeting space.  Much of the conference was in a large meeting room in the West Tower.  The lighting in there was not so great, and difficult to see the people speaking from the raised platform/stage.  Needs better spotlighting. I will say that all of the staff that I met were very nice, and willing to help.",2,1,0,0

The breakfasts were especially expensive, even the buffett (though the Oatmeal Pancakes were awesome!)

So I showed up a few hours later than my friends and went to find the room on my own.  Be sure to ask which side your friends are on (West or East) as there are two separate buildings across the street from each other.  Naturally my friends were in the other tower so I had to truck it across the street.  But no worries, it is fairly easy to navigate. Rooms: sensor locks, HDTV, coffee maker, decent sized bathroom, blow dryer, etc.  Beds were comfy and I love the pillows.  The room had pretty thin walls - we could hear the neighbor's conversation and TV show through the bathroom walls, and people walking down the hall could be heard very well.  Just bring earplugs which, to me, is mandatory to get sleep in any hotel anyway.  If you stay up high enough you will have really good views of the city.  Oh and they have the blackout curtains like the ones you get in Vegas hotel rooms.  This is the BEST.  All places should have these. Hotel itself had a bar, a huge spacious lobby, a little market with Starbucks, ATM, gift shop, etc.  Cabs were easy to get and there wasn't really a line.  You can walk to the Pier and to the Magnificent Mile.  Nothing wrong with that.

Good breakfast buffet. Comfortable bed. Downsides? Street noise (right near a fire station) and slow internet.  Lobby is a little bit of a mess with renovations ongoing.   Would I come again? Sure, if the conference were staying there. The problem is that there are so many other great places to stay nearby (eyeing the Radisson Blu) that its hard to seek this one out.

And we had this event in May so Chicago...wasn't really the ""Windy City"" that it normally is. It was like summertime. My room here was amaze-balls! I had a huge comfy King-sized bed all to myself and I remember the pillows being marshmallow heavenly snuggle bunnies. The bathroom and the room itself was very modern contemporary, just the way I like it. The BEST thing about the room was the actual view that I had. Such a gorgeous view of the city and the water! I also liked the bar they have here. It was a pretty happenin' spot. I actually enjoyed a few strong drinks here with coworkers at the time (mind you, I don't think I turned 21 yet then...sssh!). They had this HUGE fishbowl of a margarita that came out and after sipping down more than 1/2 of that, I was quite impressed with the rest of my stay. ;) I also like the promptness of the customer service here.

We arrived early on Saturday morning since we were attending the Cubs game.  We knew the rooms wouldn't be available, but checked in and left our luggage at the bell desk.  We received a call an hour or so later informing us the rooms were ready.  We stayed in the West Tower and had a beautiful room with a great view of Lake Michigan. The hotel is always crowded, but it's always been quick and friendly service.  The bar is great with good drinks and food. We were checking out on Sunday morning, but wanted to take advantage of the beautiful day and bum around the city.  We were told we could leave the car in valet parking until 6:00 which was great - most places will typically charge for another day if you keep the car past the check out time.  The bell desk was very accommodating and even suggested we head down to the lower level and the parking attendants would bring the car around so we could preload and then park it until we were ready to leave so we could avoid the lines picking up our bags later.

The room?  Also pretty nice.  The key cards don't need to be slid through the door; they are just tap onto the door and you're in, which I've seen at only one other hotel (Flatiron Toshi in Manhattan).  I had a fantastic view of the skyscrapers from my window.  I noticed that by the bedside, there weren't electrical outlets at least by the tables, but you had great flat-screen TVs. There's plenty of food options that are available.  A Starbucks in the building, a small cafe type area and also a great looking place for dinner, though I can't comment on the food as I have never had the time to eat there. Check-in and check-out are also out of this world.  You can check-in with a reeptionist, or you can check in completely on a kiosk, like you're an airport.  The check-out is also handled on the kiosks as well, as well as a drop off box before you leave as well.  The doormen are very helpful and courteous.  If you're staying for business or pleasure, see if you can snag a room at this amazing hotel situated on Wacker and not far from Michigan Ave and Grant Park.  http://Hotels.com say that many of these rooms are at least $200 a night, but if you get lucky and Priceline it, you can get yourself a great bargain.  Perfect for a romantic weekend if you're looking for a good hotel to stay the weekend in Chicago.",5,2,2,1

The bathroom was probably my favorite part of this room. I really liked the backlit mirror for some reason. I know it was cold outside, but the water did take a very long time to heat up (both the sink and the shower). The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, though there was a small towel on the floor in front of the bathroom when we first arrived and one of the pieces of art on the wall looked like it had some grease/fingerprints on it. Not a big deal, but attention to detail could have been a bit better. The walls weren't particularly soundproof either - there was a baby that was screaming for a good hour or so in the room next door to us, and it was pretty audible. Luckily it wasn't until around 9am and we were already awake anyway. Although we did get a great price on the room, there's two primary reasons I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of four: $9.95 per day for internet, and $52.00 per day for parking. I know it's the middle of the city, but come on now. Also, the business center is only open until 5pm every day so you're basically forced to pay for the internet if you need to print something.

""Do it like they do on the discovery channel?"" Yeah. All night long. FML. They're also heavy smokers and I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to do that here. This morning I woke up to the sounds of them throwing up -- not even kidding. But that's not the hotel's fault. What I love most about the Hyatt Regency is that much like the city it's in, it's so busy all the time. This has to be one of the busiest hotels I've seen and I love the energy, plus the people watching is superb. As I mentioned before, a trip to the Big Bar where you can pick up an oversized drink, is definitely in order. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby which is more than convenient. The room service is prompt and comes along with a great menu... this morning I had the ""green and white eggs"" which comes with kale, avocado, and sprouts... they have certain things designated healthier than others which I'm always a fan of. The Hyatt also has a late night menu that runs I believe until 6am, for those of you who party your pants off in Chicago. I love the energy of the Hyatt Regency, and when I told the guy at the front desk I was from St. Louis and our Cards just took game 6, he upgraded me to a king size room with a gorgeous view. Highly recommended for a downtown Chicago hotel!",5,7,4,4

We parked in the underground parking garage, and that went smoothly despite the huge crowds. We got downtown at about 12:00 p.m., and the nice front desk woman told me a room wasn't ready yet (understandably, because we were early), but someone would call me when it was. Now the problems start.  There was an area where we could leave our bags while we were waiting for our room.  We brought the bags over to the guy, who was very busy because the hotel was nuts, got a tag for them, and started to walk away.  The guy muttered ""seriously"" as we walked away, so my friend said ""sorry"" and ran back and gave him a $5 tip.  I was thinking that we would tip them at the end, but if he wanted it now, fine. We went out to the parade, had some fun, and came back a few hours later for our bags.  There was a different guy running the bag check area.  We got our bags from him, meaning we pointed at them, and he moved them about 5 feet to where we were standing.  He didn't bring them to our room or anything, he just moved them 5 feet.  We started to walk away, and this guy yelled after us ""no tip!""   Ok, I've worked in the service industry.  I realize that people want tips, and often depend on them.  We gave bag check guy number one $5 for putting a tag on our bags.  I do not think it was necessary to give bag check guy number two another $5.  Further, when is it ever appropriate to yell about tips at your customers?  There were about 1000000000 people getting their bags from these guys.  How much money is enough for them?

4024,YzAO8I0uiUaxwi,"A very solid 4-star stay! Obviously, I have not stayed at too many hotels in Chicago. As a former resident, I never had much need. But on a recent trip, it became a necessity so I set out to find the best priced hotel room downtown. A hotwire search for ""4 stars and above"" near ""downtown"" landed me a $111/night rate at the Hyatt Regency. For Thursday-Sunday! $111/night!? Chicago in the summer!? I feared that this would be a dump due to the price, but was relieved somewhat when I saw their announcement on Yelp detailing their complete renovation of all 2,000+ rooms. Wow, big hotel. Yes, indeed. This is a ""convention"" hotel, with multiple towers, huge convention spaces below and all around. It's massive. As luck would have it, the SoniCare toothbrush convention was here during my stay, so there were a lot of out-of-towners with brilliant smiles bounding around everywhere. Could be worse, right!? When you enter the lobby it actually looks more like an airport or a huge mall. Nonetheless, my check-in was quite smooth and I was on my way up to my room on the 23rd floor. What i found was quite impressive! A small room (1 Queen bed), but very modern, stylish, clean and comfortable. Flat screen TV. Very updated and you can definitely tell the remodel went full force. Things felt crisp and clean, the carpet fresh. It was just a really nice room. And on the 23rd floor...though I didn't have a river view (could've upgraded for $20, but wasn't spending a whole lot of time there!) was looking out over office buildings and Chicagoans bustling around to work and play. Suggestion, if you're here on a weekend and there is a big convention (usually), just ask to be put on those floors. Typically people from Sonicare are not going to be rowdy and loud. 18 years olds on vacation, another story. My room was quiet and peaceful at all times.   The service during my stay was also right on key. Never had an issue. I'd never eat or drink at the lounges/Stetson's with all the wonderful options nearby and in Chicago, but they had a nice snack/bev area for quick snacks. It's not cheap or anything, but it does in a pinch. Parking: You can valet (which is probably a lot) or you can park in one of the underground lots and walk a few blocks to save about half. I think we paid around $20/night. Much better and you don't have to wait in a crazy valet line in the morning! Any complaints? Just one small one. The elevators get super jammed up around the 10-11am hour, and I waited 20 minutes for one to get downtstairs on Saturday morning because all the Sonicare ladies were going somewhere at the same time. Like all 4,000 of them. So, that didn't work so hot, but everything else considered...this was indeed a ""4 star hotel, downtown"" and for $111/night! *Also, free wi-fi. I'd stay again.

4025,BarSdVAngQ5mmcPxC0ADrg,"We stayed here for 2011 Thanksgiving and really enjoyed our stay. When reading some of the reviews you have to be sure to check the date. The hotel has been remodeled and are still planning to remodel other parts of the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to check in. We asked if we could have a city view and were granted it with no extra charge. Our room felt modern and updated. The bathroom was really cool and I loved the lighting. I'm a nurse so I know all the nasty germs lurking around hotels. I am really creeped out when I see other people's hair in the shower or around the toilet. I never once saw someone else's hair! The cleaning staff is great. They cleaned our room, made the bed, replaced our towels and straighted up each day! Nothing ever went missing from our room either. Plus, at alot of hotels the cleaning staff is loud and will barge in even if you have a privacy sign on the door. Nope, not here at the Hyatt. We never heard them cleaning other rooms and they never disturbed us when we had the sign on the door. Kudos! As for location...it was perfect for us! We took the train alot to other parts of the city like out to White Sox Stadium, China town and other parts of the city. Just a few blocks away, you can catch the Red line for $2.25 a ride. Thats much cheaper than a cab! Michigan ave is right up the block too. If you are needing snacks/drinks for your stay there is a grocery store 1 block away. Go out of the side door by the computers and the bistro. Go out those doors, take a left after you walk down the stairs and the store is right down the way. We stocked up on water and crackers to avoid the high prices at the hotel. We would certainly recommend staying at the Hyatt in Chicago!",4,0,0,0

First, the Hyatt Regency in Chicago is the largest Hyatt Regency in the US. They have over 2044+ rooms and two large towers. Compared to Vegas, that may seem like nothing (Vdara houses an impressive 4408 rooms!) but here in Chicago, this landmark hotel definitely has presence. I got a deal on priceline and for once trusted my fate at a chain versus the boutique hotels I've been staying at in previous visits and I have to say, for the price I paid, it was well worth it. The front desk was pleasant, check in was easy and the room was clean. It smelled, felt, and looked clean and updated. The bed was large, comfortable, and the shower was well designed so you can let it rain or turn it on power mode to wash out that stubborn conditioner in your hair. The room service was ... OK since the hotel was big and it just takes forever to get anything but aside from that it was a very pleasant experience.

No free wifi but otherwise the amenities were satisfactory. Apparently there was a renovation recently - the room was clean and comfortably modern. Checking in and out was relatively smooth. There were two main things that bothered me. First, the chaotic nature of the hotel lobby. It was a busy weekend (air and water show) and I felt like they weren't quite prepared for it. It was raining the first morning, and it took about 30 minutes to get a taxi through the teeming mass of hydrophobic hotel goers. There wasn't much organization and the hotel didn't seem to have any pull to get a good supply of cabs. Second, the concierge desk was overall pretty useless and almost, well, snotty. Also, it costs $20 to rent an umbrella. It's refundable, but you can't put it on your bill and you can't use a card. It's $20 cash or kick rocks.

4030,ySW1NBR2QPRKvrbPVfxKyg,"I am a 'frequenter' and after the 20th time staying here,  it's consistently ranked among the best hotels I've visited for: comfort, responsive staff and comprehensive services.  It is a HUGE hotel compared to what I am used to yet I feel comfortable here. Show Me: The Hyatt is very central, I can catch the El , catch a cab, walk anywhere and it's close to great great restaurants.  So I have the food situation down by staying here.  As far as visuals, my favorite places to walk to are Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago when I  am here over the weekend- two stellar attractions in the city.  Downtown Chicago is about architecture and no where in our country can you witness amazing styles from Frank Gehry to Art Deco to modernist Chicago (I like to call it because I dont know the name, LOL).  I am not an architecture person but you cannot avoid admiring this beautiful city, the structures and how it evolved to an utopia of American life.   From atop and street level of this hotel you can witness Chicago during rush hour:  a marvel of orderliness and efficiency.  People queue up to get on public transportation 24x7.  Where in the world do you see behaviour like this?  It's not like NY where ""it's every man for himself""   The subterranean roads for trucks/deliveries  separate from city traffic is genius!  Whoever thought about this solution was way ahead of her time!  I am constantly amazed that such a huge metropolis functions efficiently day in and day out, chaos minimized.  There's still traffic yes but somehow rush hour 'feels' organized here. Stay & Work: Pan back to your personal space.  Rooms at the HR are modern, very comfortable but not spacious by Cali standards.    Be prepared these are Euro/ NY-sized rooms.  I've received faxes (delivered when requested), I've sent faxes, received packages, nothing lost.  I've requested printing services, messengering, even paper and what sets the HR apart is I don't get the ""No you can't "" vibe here.   Service is prompt.  I bring a data card everywhere I go so WIFI is not an issue. I can work here and request a service and in 10 minutes max, bingo!   Gym facilities are up-to-date and clean.   I love the workout/cardio machines here more than any of the other (""Big 4"") hotels  and depend on them regularly.  I especially appreciate who ever thought about the shape of the Hyatt gym towels, they're super long enough to wrap around your neck..... long enough to lay on a machine to cover the back of your head down to your back.    If you are concerned about hygiene at the gym, you know what I am talking about.    The heating/cooling systems are efficient and never had a complaint.  Hyatt is truly making an effort to be distinct.  They're checkin process is different from most hotels.  I feel the lodging experience here is about comfort and personal service. Leave Me Alone: When you hang the DND tag on your door, they will not knock even if its after 1pm.  The will expect  for you to call Housekeeping when you want your room to be serviced or not at all.    No accidental knocking from housekeeping.  In the morning hours, housekeeping staff tend to work in the background, unobtrusively.  I like that.......Lemme sleep however long if I want to! Feed me: Food-wise, I can order a perfectly grilled steak (not cheap) or surf and turf made in the same style as a superior steakhouse like Gibsons (a mile down the block).  Oddly almost any restaurant closeby, high-end or not, will deliver to the Hyatt, no extra charge.   I use my trusty Yelp app to monocle a restaurant closeby.   I've done this before a few times...........  in the dead of winter when there's absolutely no way I'm going out there!!!.  Not even to walk 4 steps into a cab.  No way, ah- ah....LOL! I can survive in this hotel without leaving it's premises. Visits:  20+",4,13,5,2

The bathrooms, too, were generously sized with great lighting. The extras were also good quality--yes, I am very picky about the soaps and shampoos that are in the room.

In fact, if you stand long enough in the bathroom, you can actually HEAR conversations from within the elevator. So, note: if you receive a room near the elevator lobby, I suggest you change it. As for that airplane noise, I stayed in the hotel next door last year, and didn't hear a thing from the outdoors. Moving on, we were given a room in the newly renovated tower, which still had that ""new carpet"" scent. The room was huge and spacious, with a nice view of the city. The beds at the Hyatt are ALWAYS comfortable -- I love them so much, I want to buy one. But the pillows? Suck hard core. Every Hyatt now seems to stock these tiny, almost square head pillows. If I'm in a King bed, I kind of want matching King pillows, you know what I'm saying? The people who work here are amazing -- everyone from the luggage guy to the concierge to the check-in/out staff, and even the guy who hails the cabs for you. I like that the hotel has a mini store on the lower level, where I was able to purchase coffee, milk and cereal, a banana and a variety of other snacks for the room. That said, you know it costs like 3x more than if you bought it in a store yourself ($8 for said bowl of cereal, big chug milk & banana). Oh, the sake of convenience, right?

It's close to the usual assortment of tourist mandated visits but it's also a great location for just getting outside and taking a walk through Downtown Chicago. The Staff is extremely friendly and they really do go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  I mean even the maids greet you in the hallway when they see you.   Meal choices are fair, but expect to pay top dollar to eat, or drink, in the hotel.  It's Chicago, get out and eat somewhere else.  The parking is extremely over-priced at $50 a night.  We opted to rent a car from Enterprise (within walking distance) and turned it in every night for less than $32 a day for a compact car. The gym is placed in an odd location and it looks like it was just put there because the space is probably un-usable for anything else.  Nonetheless, a good assortment of ellipticals and treadmills, all with tv's built in.  There were also some weight machines and free weights, butfloor space is limited and more than 2 people and you've got a problem. WiFi is not complimentary and I believe it's like $10 a day.  I found that rather cheesy, but I paid it anyway out of necessity.  The rooms were nice and roomy and mine overlooked the Chicago River and Navy Pier.  The wall were however paper thin as one night our next door neighbor received a call from his wife at 2:30am and proceeded to rip into his ass about leaving when their 5 year old child has an ear infection...and she had to work late.  Never fret, after 15 minutes he calmed her down and got his mother to come over and help with ""Brandon.""  and yes, we heard all that!

Had drinks in the Bar 151 inside, and also the ""Big Bar"" - nothing like paying $6.50 for a domestic bottle beer and $11 for a Bloody Mary, but I guess that's the price you pay for convenience of being in a hotel bar. The bathrooms were nice, could have used a little more counter-space but whatever :) I like a fairly roomy bathroom and they had good ones. I wasn't a fan of the toiletries in the room, NO one in our party liked the lotion (LOL, we had two adjoining rooms) but I always bring my own anyway.

Great price point if you get it online (we got our reservation off of hotwire). Really nice staff. Amazing number of electricity plugs. We had four girls in a room and not once did we have to hunt for an outlet. Cons - NO free Wifi anywhere, including the lobby. The TV quality was pretty bad, but who goes to Chicago to watch TV?? Some notes about their gym: Great up-to-date equipment. They offer cold towels, but no sanitary towels to wipe down the eqipment which was odd.

4044,rYjIifZfnACOcEhW,"The rooms here are pretty nice, however we had some bad luck and got a room right next to the elevator.  Those elevators are very fast and apparently also very loud, because we could hear them all night long.  The view from our room was amazing though....a straight shot of the Hancock Observatory with the river in front. The bar on the 2nd floor was fun and a good view of the river, although drinks were pricey...what you'd expect from a hotel bar I guess. We tried to check out through the TV checkout and it didn't work which was a minor annoyance because we didn't want to have to wait in line downstairs (the hotel was super busy the whole time we were there). Overall just an okay experience.  Nothing stood out, and next time we'd be sure to request a room away from the elevator.",3,0,0,0
4045,LGkBumQ8HBqROhLvWZLdQA,"I'm torn between the 4 star review and the 3. It's actually a 3.5 star. Pros: - Super close to touristy attractions either directions: Magnificent mile, Cloud gate, Navy Pier, etc. - Close to public transport ie 5 blocks or so to Red line - Attractive lobby - Friendly and helpful staff - Secure rooms that require a key to enter elevators after 11PM or so. Cons: - A somewhat dreary room with the color scheme, which looks contemporary in the pictures, but not so in person. - The glass window in our room was dirty with streak marks and such as if they haven't cleaned it in a while... I suppose this was an excellent deal for the location and all, but I expected a little bit more from a 4 star hotel. Maybe it was listed as 3.5stars. Either way, our request of a king bed was confirmed when we checked in, but when we got to the room, it was a double. No biggie I guess. It was nice though that they allowed us to extend our check out time to 1PM instead of 12PM when I called the morning of check-out.",3,1,0,0

Most notably, Tamika Y. from the catering group who really went above and beyond to help me when I was in a bind, and Eric from the business center who was just great and also went above and beyond in helping me take care of my shipments. - very centrally located in DT Chicago - room service food was pretty damn good  AND quick; 20 minutes tops and I ordered twice. CONS: - there was a union strike with the housekeeping staff which made the atmosphere generally uncomfortable and ps I hope what I read abt the Hyatt's treatment of their staff was untrue! - I echo another Yelper's review here: my room was right next to the elevators too and wow...the best way I can think of describing the noise is to think of planes flying overhead ...

4051,CebQ-W6Ob2J5F043-XkkCw,"While the renovation at this place looks great (you can see they poured all their money into the lobby/restaurant area), there were more than a few issues with the room. First off, the view, was excellent, from the 32nd floor, peering thru the Chicago skyline and looking down at the Chicago River. The beds were also comfortable but that's where the good stuff ends. First, parking. The only on-site parking is via valet ($35 each time you park) or $50 all night valet. You can park at a nearby parking garage for around $25-$30, but for a major chain in a major city, I expected some on-site parking that didn't involve ridiculous parking fees. Next, the amenities. The reception on the TV is terrible. Some of the channels barely came in. The water pressure on the shower was weak (weaker than the usual hotel water pressure). The air conditioner/fan would still circulate air into the room even though the panel had the thing turned off. After two nights, this resulted in a very dry/sore throat. Finally, the concierge. Hit or miss with these folks. A couple of them were friendly, polite and knew what they were talking about. Then  there were those who just didn't belong behind that desk. From the guy who gave us the wrong directions back to Midway (if we followed his directions we would have ended up in Indiana) and the lady who told us parking across the street was ony $23/night (it was actually $30) and the guy who sarcastically joked that the fitness area didn't have ""cool stuff"" like a jacuzzi or sauna to a whole list of other tidbits that I've since pushed out of my mind, the conceirge service at this hotel is questionable. Also, I'm not sure if they're still there, but there's a bunch of strikers/picketters outside the hotel and from a brief conversation with fellow guests who were staying on the 16th floor, they could hear them banging their pots and blowing their horns at night.

The good: - The hotel was clean, the room was nice and surprisingly quiet, with great views - Great location. Minutes to Millennium Park and the Loop. The bad: - Internet costs $14/day, and even if you pay for it, it doesn't work on the levels where the conference is being held. Ridiculous. No, ridiculous isn't a strong enough word, but I don't think Yelp allows me to use stronger language.  Because the conference rooms were all in the basement levels, cellphone and 4G service for your laptops/tablets was also sketchy at best. - I never ate at any of the hotel restaurants, but I did eat food provided at conference functions, and was thoroughly underwhelmed by all of it. - The Hyatt is currently having a labor dispute with the housekeeping staff.

I'm not a fan of their toiletry products -- I wish they would upgrade them to a more luxurious brand, and while this isn't exactly a dealbreaker, it would increase my love of the Hyatt brand if they stepped it up a bit in this department. I was in the West Tower and had a bizarre view of an office building -- I could see in to their offices and they could see in to my room!

However, since that'd be quite a short review, allow me to elaborate: i found this hotel on Hotwire for the low low price of $70 a night. I have a feeling it would have been a lot more had I not booked it before there was a playoffs game scheduled the same weekend. It was worth this price, I guess, but I still wasn't pumped about my stay. First off, the hotel is really not all that convenient for public transport. We had to hoof it to Clark and Lake to catch most all of the trains. In the Spring/Summer/Fall that would be OK, but in Winter it just meant we took a lot of cabs. Suddenly the $70 room got a lot more expensive. Second, our room was TINY! The walls were paper thin, so we could hear every frickin conversation in the room next door. And they were boring conversations. The bathroom is right off the bed, and is only separated by a sliding glass door. Sometimes when two people are sharing a room they don't want the other person to hear your bathroom noises. This was impossible in our room. I tried to turn on the sink to disguise them, but the water pressure is so low that wasn't much of a help. Still, the room was clean and had a fantastic view.

Since everything seemed to be located downtown we decided to stay at the Hyatt. What a great decision. EVERYTHING was within walking distance. Millennium Park was two blocks south, you're practically on the Magnificent Mile, about one mile SW was the Willis Tower (and a mile really isn't that far of a walk people), and lastly, you're only a block or two from the lakefront and river boat tours. The concierges were great. We arrived fairly late, around 1ish in the am, and they were very accommodating and friendly. She even asked if I wanted a room with a waterfront view with no extra charge, but  unfortunately the rooms with direct view were all booked. She still gave me the best she could find and we were still able to see the river as we laid in our bed. My airline lost my son's carseat and lent me one for temporary use till ours was found. The concierges took care of switch when my son's carseat arrived with out a problem. My only complaint would be their parking. It cost $50 per night for their valet service (no private lot).

I try to avoid Chicago at all costs. O'Hare is a nightmare and something ALWAYS goes wrong when I fly through. Well this trip was no different. One canceled flight later, I was on my way to the Regency Hyatt in the Loop - I mean, come on, I'm not going to stay at the airport. I got the room at an absolute steal on Priceline (the airlines don't pay for anything nowadays - but that is another review). When I arrived I was dubious to say the least.

I was just talking about my flight being canceled and the nightmare of getting downtown on public transportation because of construction, etc. Not really bitching - just talking. Well - the fabulous Gabrielle - informed me that she was upgrading me to a suite and then proceeded to give me a voucher for free room service and 2 free drinks in the bar!

Despite all the numerous conventions and events going on, they still need to fill up those vacant rooms. Of course if I had to choose on my next visit to the Windy City, I would choose another hotel just for a different experience. Check-in was nice and easy. The lady helping us was pleasant enough. But before I could even request a bigger room or a nicer view, we were quickly handed the keys. They probably have a big red sign flashing in red on their computer screen saying ""casual tourists, not corporate accounts."" I asked if we could get access to the Regency Club for the free breakfast daily, that got shot down. Extra $75. No thanks. Our room was no-frills, with a nice big view of an office building. Big flat screen TV and a comfortable bed, that's pretty much all we need. The walls are as thin as tissue paper, as you can hear people flushing the toilet, sneezing, or talking in the hallway. No fridge, no free Wi-Fi, or any other ""luxury"" amenities. Safe to say, I wouldn't pay anywhere near the standard rates listed on their website. Priceline prices, yeah it's about right. Maybe even a little less. Of course, the biggest advantage with this hotel is the location. We stayed in the West tower, so the elevator conveniently spits you out to Wacker street and you're on your way. It's centrally located, so you can either go north to Magnificent Mile or south to the Loop, where there is Millenium Park, Willis Tower, Art Institute, etc. Plus, it's close to all the bus and train stations.

(One of the buttons was broken.)  I also found that the desk chair had a broken arm.  I called the ""exceptional service"" button that is supposed to take care of any guest needs.  After waiting for about 7 minutes on hold (ugh) the woman said, ""Oh, safes are security's issue.  I'll connect you.""  So before I could tell her about the broken chair I was on hold with security.  I finally got through and told them the safe had a single broken button, but it was the important one that locks the safe!  He said he would send someone up right away.   While I was waiting I figured I'd call ""exceptional service"" and get the chair fixed too.  After another 8 minutes on hold I got the agent and she said they would have someone come up and fix it.   Nobody showed up for either issue.  I had to eventually leave, and when I got back later that night the safe was still not fixed, and neither was the chair.  There was no message and no note.  They ignored the issues.  I called again and went through the same run-around.  After 5 days at the hotel they never fixed the safe or the chair!  Sheesh! On the bright side, the Regency Club did have a nice view of the river and the lake (as did my room).  The breakfast wasn't terrible in the club (they actually had a pretty good quality lox).  I wish the bagels were fresher to match up to the lox though.  But I digress.   I did appreciate they had ample bottles of water to drag around in the heat, as well as some nice fresh fruit (the plums and peaches were particularly good).   Overall I'm not sure I will ever stay in a conference hotel again!  I will go back to my old conference strategy of finding a nice hotel nearby and enjoying the stay a bit more, while having a place to get away to as well during the craziness of the conference!",2,5,3,1

4069,H722eNyoqjNPsqV-MP191g,"I forgot to review the hotel we stayed at recently (October 2007) during our trip to Chicago for a conference. I remembered to review our horrible dining experience at one of the restaurants here (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) -- but neglected to review our stay in one of the rooms. We stayed for a few nights - check in was fine. The lady was training someone, but everything was fast and efficient. The only negative was that we reserved a king size bed, but the only room left with one was one equipped for wheelchairs. She asked if that would be OK, and in my haste, I said sure. I shouldn't have. The room was horrible. The negatives piled up. First of all, the shower. That was the worst aspect of the room. The showerhead was ""removable"", attached to a bar where it could slide up and down - to adjust height I suppose. The problem here is that it would slide down on it's own... so if I wanted to clean my lower half and not my upper half it would have been great. Or if I was three feet tall. So I was constantly readjusting the shower. Not to mention the shower never felt that clean (paint peeling and water damage... and a few bugs). Oh, and it was like a tub with no sides. Secondly, there was no counter in the bathroom - so there was nowhere to put any of your stuff. At all. I actually took a luggage rack, placed towels over the straps, and put my bathroom bag on it. Ridiculous.   Another annoying factor was the door - it was configured so when you opened it, it stayed open... for way too long. It would have been fine if there was an optional button to operate the door (for a wheelchair), but it was sort of power operated so no matter what it stayed open for at least 10 or 15 seconds after you enter. So the entire floor can essentially see in your room for that long. So you kind of stand there awkwardly and wait for the door to close before proceeding. The positive for the room was the bed. It was wonderful. One of the only hotel room beds where I wake up not aching. OK, perhaps the only one I can remember where I didn't wake up aching. So that's a big plus. I guess the location was too, but it was awfully far away from the convention center.  Lobby was meh and the food options not great (especially if you want to eat healthy), room service or anything like renting a movie was grossly expensive (even for a hotel).

No good, I said. I made a quick call to get a room change and ended movin' on up to the east side- literally. I was given a new room on the 29th floor with a dazzling view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. The front desk clerk who gave me my new keys, Moji, couldn't have been more pleasant. Plus, the Hyatt is perfect for out of town guests as it equidistant between Millennium Park and the Mag Mile. Hurray for the Hyatt!",4,3,1,0

Everyone has conventions here, so it's always packed. It's an older hotel, too, so it feels kind of grungy. There are two buildings. The rooms are fine. It's got what you need and relatively comfortable. The shampoo/conditioner is pretty terrible though- no surprise there. One thing I found really weird was that they have machines for quick check-in/check-out. I thought hotels were supposed to be all about service, so it was strange that they purposely set it up so that we didn't talk to an employee during our entire stay.",3,0,0,0

The Hyatt's lobby is beautifully laid out with a dining area encircle by a zen-like pond with delicately ""spitting"" waterfalls.  You can watch t.v. while waiting or just relaxing on the many sofas and chairs.  Their bar offers a stunning backdrop view of the city.   Once again, this is a hotel with lots of conventions so to get from point A to B, may take 10 mins, but the majority of all convention hotels are like that.  The difference is that you get a lovely view on your way there. Tip:  Purchase the unlimited transit passes.  DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR into Chicago.  Chicago has one of the best public transit systems that I've experienced.  Besides, it'll cost you at least $40 or more to park your car overnight at the hotels.

I did not appreciate the ill flushing toilet. Also, 26 floors up and you would think I'd get awesome cell reception, but no. Living within concrete walls for a long weekend did not please my phone. Concierge was helpful, elevator was pretty fast, as long as you weren't stopping on every floor. Hairdryer is found in a black bag hanging in the closet, if you seemed to miss it in the bathroom. Careful though, my friend blew the circuits using it on high and was without power for 30 minutes. I liked the ipod doc, nice touch. Made our preparties a bit more lively.

To be quite honest, I probably wouldn't give them that fifth star, if it weren't for the following situation: Last Thursday, I came down with the flu. I was planning on staying at my apartment, but my landlord still hadn't left for Singapore. I went back to the Hyatt after making new reservations. The concierge (who, at this point recognised me by sight because I've slept in their bed more than I did in my New York apartment) took one look at me and asked me if I needed some medication. I got to my room, and within five minutes, he'd personally brought up Tylenol, because he didn't want to have the usual 5-10min delay that would happen if he had housekeeping do it. Yes, he got a nice letter written for him afterwards :) Another story: 2 colleagues and I were staying at this hotel. Since I was staying longer (did I mention I spent more nights in the Hyatt than I did anywhere else this month?) than them, we were on separate reservations. They screwed up their room -- they gave them what is basically a party suite -- one bed in one room and the other room had bunch of couches with a pull-out bed. They were upgraded immediately to the executive floor, with zero hassles. I guess they wanted to keep our hotwire.com-based business ;) To be fair, the rooms are slightly dated -- no LCD TVs, lacking iPod docks in every room, etc. Even the executive floor (don't know about the suites) look a little dated, though they are nicer. The beds are comfortable, though, and the view can be great if you're lucky -- either to Millenium Park or towards the Maginificent Mile.",5,2,2,0

4082,HDIUzUlWfLh-qrIQV00PGA,"The mark of a great business establishment, especially a place like a hotel, can be found in the staff's ability not just to deliver great service, but also in the display of their problem-solving skills when it comes to customer service. Based on the outcome of the following story, I would choose the Hyatt as my place to stay every time I come into Chicago from now on. I was working as a volunteer at an event on the Navy Pier, sponsored by the NPO I work for. Naturally, as a ""volunteer employee"", my hotel and travel accommodations were supposed to be taken care of once I followed the proper procedures for filling out paperwork and obtaining confirmation numbers. The flight was fine, the trip from O'Hare (mostly) uneventful. But imagine my shock and surprise, when my partner and I arrived at the hotel and we were informed that THE ROOMS WEREN'T PAID FOR. NOW was the time that the event coordinator chose to tell me that we were expected to pay for the rooms in advance OURSELVES, to be reimbursed at a later date. ""Mortified"" doesn't even begin to describe how I felt, especially since I didn't have a credit card that would cover the entire expense of the stay. At that moment, I was pretty much ready to haul it out of there and find the nearest Motel 6, Econolodge or Days Inn. But it was thanks to the quick and diplomatic thinking of Jennifer, the front desk rep, that the situation was made easier. She advised me and the event coordinator about what to do (obviously, this was not the first time she'd had to deal with a problem like this.) Plus, in the meantime, she made sure we still got a room at least for the night, (with a SPECTACULAR 27th floor view of ""The Loop"".) I won't bore you with the other details, but the situation was eventually resolved and we all lived (and slept and dined) happily ever after. Not only is the atrium of the Hyatt dazzling to behold (with probably the world's most interesting designer fountains), but the quality of the customer service didn't stop with Jennifer. I think everyone there did an outstanding job, but personally, I think Jennifer deserves a raise.  And the Hyatt deserves my future business, which they will most definitely have the next time we return to Chicago.",5,2,1,1
4083,kZ8GukOinYkS6KAVW6paGg,"3.5 stars. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago on Saturday night after getting it on Priceline for $55/night. The hotel is in a very good location with plenty to walk to right near it. If you are coming from Midway Airport, I highly recommend taking the train. It's about 30 minutes, $2.25, and less than a 10 minute walk from the Randolph/Wabash station (we found this to be the more convenient station to the hotel rather than the Lake/State Street one). Even though we got to the hotel at 11 am, we were able to check in and go to our room on the 32nd floor. The room itself was a pretty basic king bed room, but we didn't need anything fancy or special for one night. I did find the placement of the flat screen TV a bit odd as it was on the end of the dresser on the right side of the bed, so if were laying in bed, you could to be on your side to see it. For booking via Priceline, we actually had a room with a decent view. The only amenity we utilized at the hotel was the business center which is on the bottom level. Use of the internet for 15 minutes will run you $7.56 and printing one page will cost $0.83. So only use the business center if you really have to. If you want to use cabs to get around, there are plenty in queue all the time near the hotel, so you won't have to wait to get one. Overall, this hotel is not a bad option especially since it looks like it's pretty easy to book for a great price on Priceline.",3,2,1,0

Just as other reviewers said, we booked with hotwire/priceline and were given this hotel. We had actually stayed here in the past for NYE and enjoyed it so we figured this would be a good experience, boy were we wrong! First of all, this place is huge, there are two different wings and it can become frustrating if you hop on the wrong elevator to get to your room (you'll end up on the opposite side of the hotel). The lobby is kind of corny but it's cute and I can guess its for tourists. The rooms are decent, nothing to run home about and definitely not 5 star material. We went to check in and were told that there was a 100 dollar authorization charge (never heard of 100, usually its 50...but whatever), we gladly paid and went to our room. We got to the room and everything was fine until I noticed we didnt have any cups/ glasses. So we called for them and they didnt come, we called back and they sent them up (30 minutes later). We went out that night, came back into the hotel and literally as SOON as we got off the hotel a male security guard began following behind us. I became alarmed because I did not see any Hyatt branding on his clothing but he was holding a walkie talkie....anyway he began to ask us if we were guests at the hotel and we told him yes. He then demanded to know what room we were staying in, I didnt tell him and continued to yell at us and follow us to our room. When he saw that we had keys, he walked away.

I turned the air down when I arrived and then went out for a few hours. When I got back it was still warm. Called down (difficult to do, see below) and Juan arrived, saying he wished the hotel would give us a disclaimer. Their air system is not the type that blows air into the room, and it's silent. So no white noise. But he said they'd bring me a fan right away. To call the operator, one dials zero as expected, but then one gets a stupid robot giving options; speak the name of the employee or department you wish to reach, or press zero for the operator. I already pressed zero! Odd. After an hour I had not received my fan. I pressed the one touch button on the phone for exceptional stay.

We had about 5 different news channels, 1 channel that showed a 24 hr. infomercial on prosthetic hands, and Russia Today. Really? My third complaint was the lack of wifi.

Staff service is generally good, though when a convention comes in, it can slip a bit, thanks to all the demands made on their time. Both times I have been in this hotel, though, there have been conventions, and service quality remained fairly high. Big Bar is passable, though not terribly exciting. The club/dancefloor space was rather popular when I stayed, but I wouldn't want to spend any time on the lower floors on club nights--it is tremendously loud.

Also, when you REQUEST a king sized room, I don't care to hear that you're out, you're gonna give me a double.  Especially when the double rooms are NOT queen sized beds, but rather teeny full sized beds that make me feel that I'm gonna fall out.

4111,KN2GrMnNm,"I will preface this by saying that Hyatt is my favorite big-chain hotel property.  They seem to consistently deliver from town to town, with a clean, modern feel that extends from the rooms to the common areas.  I think that the fact that there are almost always herds of middle aged conventioneers adds an invigorating buzz to the atmosphere, but if you don't like them, its not too hard to avoid by going directly to your room.  I don't think the exercise room gets too busy either because these folks are preoccupied with getting their drink on and ""working the crowd"" (interpret that however you'd like). This Hyatt is particularly interesting because you can access the weird  miniworld that exists underneath the buildings in this area (offices, predominately).  So if the weather is bad out, you might be able to find a few places open during business hours.  I somehow stumbled into it one night and it was a bit eerie because everything was closed, but still lit up and walkable.  Sorta like the mall equivalent of a ghost town.  I find it a bit odd that no one else has mentioned it, so maybe I imagined the whole thing.  Spoooooky....

Today was my first time staying at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago and when the taxi pulled up to the entrance, I must say I was unimpressed....it looks very old and dated.  Once I walked through the doors however, I was so pleased!  It's very modern and updated inside.  There's a beautiful fountain in the entrance that a bistro/bar overlooks.  There's also a 2nd floor bar that overlooks this same fountain.  I make my way up the escalators to the 2nd floor check in and was greeted by Jason Dennard at the check in counter.  He was so pleasant and accomodating.  He took the time to ask where I was coming in from, how was my day, etc.  He asked my prefernce for a room, ie; king or 2 queens...I respond by saying 'king'....he looks for the room options and informs me that the only available king room is by the elevator - in which he suggested I don't take that room.  I really appreciated him telling me this, particularly after reading some of the other reviews regarding noise.   I make my way to the west tower to go to my room.  There's a west and east tower - this place is huge, but everything is well marked and easily walkable.  I decide to forgo a night on the town and order room service - the menu offers all the basics - nothing too fancy unless you choose to order from Stetson's (their in-house Steak House) but expect to pay $34 for a filet or $30 for the salmon.  Instead, I opt for the vegetarian wrap, tomato soup, and a glass of Oregon pinot gris.  Either I was really hungry, or this was the best 'room service' meal I've ever had.  It was so fresh - the wrap had asparagus, red pepper, eggplant, zuchini, and a white bean puree to hold it all together.  I honestly wasn't expecting much, and this far exceeded my expectations.   The rooms are comfortable with modern decor.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,0,0,0

4126,gTZHpBc8ztzomENW2XQ0kQ,"I recently attended the College Art Association 98th annual conference (CAA2010) at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.  As just a hotel, this place is great.  The hotel is huge and it is conveniently located near basically everything downtown.  But, when it's filled with conference attendees, it makes navigating the lobby, getting through the revolving door, or trying to get a taxi frustrating, particularly when you're in a hurry and everyone else is just milling about. At one point a big Saturday-night crowd got stuck in the revolving doors on their way to exit the building.  It took three doormen to unstick the door.  Now, clearly, this can be chalked up to the guests' stupidity, but it seems to me that these herky-jerky, stopping-starting revolving doors can be improved on. The ballroom---the location of the CAA2010 book fair---is in an absurd and rather inaccessible location.  From my room on the 26th floor, I took the elevator down to the first floor, then a set of escalators down two more flights, then walked across a big lobby, through a corridor cramped with academics conversing, across another lobby just teeming with people, and then down another set of escalators.  I was an exhibitor at the book fair and toting my credit card terminals, supplies, conference program and other documents, as well as my handbag, camera bag, and all of my winter gear, was hugely inconvenient.  Also, three floors down, there is no cell phone service.  I have a brand-new iPhone 3GS, and could make no calls, nor access 3G or wifi down there.  As a hotel that hosts, no doubt, countless conventions each year, I find this issue preposterous. As far as the room goes, it was quite nice.  Roomy, huge TV, lots of furniture, modern décor, great view, mini bar, excellent water pressure in the shower.  At one point I dropped my book on the floor and knelt down to pick it up, only to see a whole mess of dust bunnies on the floor at the head of the bed.  Also there was a Fat Tire bottle cap---not mine, I swear---in the corner of the bathroom floor, which was not picked up until my third day in the hotel.  My room was for the most part nice and quiet; I occasionally heard folks walking by my door through the hallway, but I couldn't hear through the walls like I so often have at other hotels.  The sheets were nice and I can't sleep in sheets with low thread counts, so that's saying a lot!  The bed and huge mass of pillows felt comfortable and luxurious. The staff were friendly and made me feel super-special for being a Gold Member, which I'm pretty sure just means I signed up for their rewards program. The elevator situation wasn't any more annoying or inconvenient than it usually is at a hotel filled with conventioneers all going up and all staying on different floors, but at one point the elevator I was on alone stopped on floor 19 while en route to 26 and would not budge.  Luckily, the door opened and I was exactly on the floor (not halfway in the elevator shaft like you see in action flicks), so I was able to disembark and catch another elevator up to 26. The gym was lovely.  Spacious, with plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, as well as free weights, kettlebells, weight bars, resistance bands, and stability balls.  And those Stay-Fit-at-Hyatt gym towels are better than any I've ever seen.  I have to confess, I have a bit of a collection here at home for my own personal use.  The treadmills and ellipticals have display screens where you can run on a track or in the mountains, watch TV, or listen to your iPod.  The iPod attachment charges your device as you listen.  It's pretty rad. All told, I would stay here again.  I just hope that either the Hyatt increases its connectivity in the ballroom or else the next convention I attend in Chicago is held at the Sheraton across the river, where wifi and cell phone signals are a non-issue.",3,0,0,0
4127,Fc2TigSPiTzCPBDYV288mA,"I booked a room at the Hyatt for my girlfriend's birthday.  Even though we're from Chicago and we actually don't live that far away from the Hyatt, I still thought it'd be a nice thing to do.  And of course, I could partly be blame for the room, because in general, Priceline has been consistent in giving me high quality hotels.  For example, I got a stay at the Fairmont last year and for the most part, that hotel was fantastic.   The Hyatt though?  For the price that I paid, it was nothing spectacular.  For the price that I paid + having to listen to cars and trucks rumble along lower Wacker/Columbus for the night?  Absolutely horrid.  I'll try to point out some of the highlights and shortcomings here - categorically, per usual. Location: 5 out of 5 Can't really beat it if you're a tourist.  Conveniently located and within walking distance to multiple attractions.  Cabs and shuttles know where it is too so if you're flying in, you won't be stuck trying to explain where it is. Customer Service: 3 out of 5 Caveat here.  You know who the friendliest people were at this hotel?  The people working the front door either greeting guests as they arrived, or hailing the cabs.   I really didn't get a good feel from anyone else working at the hotel.  They all seemed preoccupied with something else, and honestly, I really didn't care since it was only for one night.   Even the automatic check in kiosk was disappointing.  I ALWAYS go for the kiosks if they're available because it saves me time and I don't have to wait for any doofuses.  This kiosk though - wow, slow as dirt.  It may be the one time when checking in with the actual people behind the desk would have been faster.  Anyway. Quality of Room: 3 out of 5 No real complaints - spacious, comfortable, boutique'ish toiletries.  Like I mentioned earlier, if you get stuck facing the wrong way, you'll hearing cars and trucks rumbling throughout the night.  Since I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, I didn't notice it too much, but if you're trying to watch TV, it can be a real pain in the ass. Price: 3 out of 5 Sure, I Priceline'd it, but honestly, I expected just a little bit more than what was offered.  Before you comment and say, ""It's a great hotel, look at all the amenities!"" hear me out.  When you really strip away everything that overwhelms you when you first walk in and look at it piecewise instead of as one big picture - you'll be underwhelmed.  Glass ceilings, little pond with fountains, an ""open aired"" dining area, the escalators - get past all of that and when you do, the hotel becomes above average and not any more than that. Overall: 3 out of 5 I guess bidders can't be choosers.  Not a terrible hotel, but not really anything to write home about either.  Unless you're here on yelp.",3,0,0,0

The place was undergoing major renovations, so the outside of the buildings and the (main) east tower was kind of a mess, which maybe explained why they may have been short staffed or disgruntled.  We stayed in the West tower and it was quiet and the rooms were nice and comfortable, with good views. The service was rotten though.  The maids never once replaced anything they removed from our room.  If I ever wanted fresh glasses, ice bucket bags, or shampoo/conditioner, I had to call the maid service and request them.  And when I called, I usually got attitude: ""Can I get turn-down service tonight while we're out this evening?"" ""OK, someone will be up shortly."" ""And would you ask the maids to possibly check and replace any used or empty items around our room while they're up here?""

4136,RbSRHcw3uLLE-sf0twS1aA,"Priceline sent us here when we booked through Priceline (name your own price) and this stay was definitely worth it!  Though the sheer size of this place is enough to make you feel like a small fish (2100 rooms, what?!) the room we stayed in was quite large and spacious.   Linens were clean and crisp, beds were comfortable and downy, and our room was SUPER quiet and dark.  Granted, we were in the west wing, and had a nice view into the neighboring business high rise.  If you're like me, you'll spend half your time in the morning watching all the people laboring away, and be glad you're not them.   The staff was very helpful and the woman at the check in counter supplied me with a map and a detailed list of neighboring parking garages.  Valet is 50 dollars here.  Though the thought of unlimited in/out privileges is appealing, spare yourself a bunch of cash and park at one of the other spots.  Millennium garage, directly behind Hyatt and next to the little grocery store, is 30/overnight.  Its indoor, clean, and safe!  There are reduced rates for being there 12 hours or less. The hotel is also located very close to the infamous Michigan Avenue, where you will find the art museum, millennium park, numerous fancy-pants boutiques and stores.  Plenty of sights to see, lots of people to watch, and just a quick walk back to your room. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.",4,1,0,0
4137,JPJTbgh159TjR5nrQDxPIg,"During our stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, we enjoyed being only a few blocks from Millenium Park, Macy's and the Art Institute. Our beautiful room (1064 in the East Tower) overlooked the Chicago River and the Magnificent Mile skyline. Automatic check-in was quick and easy. We arrived before the 3 p.m. check-in and were able to check our luggage easily. Before we settled in, my husband did his usual 10-minute bedbug search with high-beam flashlight and magnifying glass, and there is no problem here. My number one priority in hotels is getting a good night's sleep, and we slept beautifully. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the linens and pillows of high quality. The blackout curtains did their job, and there was no noise from the street or adjacent rooms (the hotel was full at least one of the nights we were there, so we did have neighbors). We visited in the summer, and the room and public areas were always delightfully cool. Transportation was excellent, with the Number 6 bus to Loop stores and Hyde Park stopping in front of the hotel, and the Number 151 Michigan Avenue bus on the corner. Valet parking was easy, and there was always a line of cabs at the hotel. The housekeeper was very nice and she kept the room spotless. The shower felt great! Hotel staff is genuinely friendly and helpful, with none of the ""have a nice day"" automatic civility of many businesses that cater to the public. After I tried and failed to get tickets for Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House tour, I turned to the concierge, and she walked me through booking the tour on the Robie House website and printing the tickets. Another concierge printed driving directions back home for us. Breakfast Buffet: The selection and presentation is terrific. It's like attending 12 bar mitzvahs!  Manuel made me a wonderful omelet, cooking the onions and mushrooms thoroughly, as I requested, before adding the spinach and cheddar cheese I had selected. The fruit cup and pineapple spears were very fresh. There are options to match any appetite and special diet, and for those without time to wait for an omelet, there were at least a dozen egg and pancake dishes on the steam table. Smoked salmon, excellent cheeses (including artisan cheddar, goat cheese and brie) and freshly made waffles were available, and there was an extensive selection of breads, pastries, cereal and drinks. Service was exceptional!  Manuel brought my omelet to the table, and the waiter brought me coffee, water and a newspaper. One of my restaurants pet peeves is constant sound. While there were televisions in the dining area, the sound is muted, leaving guests in blessed silence to enjoy this fabulous breakfast. The workout room was clean and well equipped, and you can hook up your iPod to the cardio machines. My husband and I enjoyed a drink at The Big Bar. The negatives: Constant noise from the bathroom fan, loud enough that we had to keep the bathroom door closed; a squeaky bathroom door; and intermittent motor-like noise from above the ceiling. I asked to have these problems fixed and they weren't. Also, the flat screen television did not have a very good picture, most shows were not high definition and there was no programming guide. At one point during our stay our key cards stopped working. Assistant Front Office Manager Rocco LaFronza was just delightful. He got us into our room and comped us breakfast buffet the next day, turning a negative experience into a positive.   I look forward to staying at this luxurious hotel again.",5,1,0,0

Pros- Great rates are always available on Hotwire, Room are fairly large, queen size beds, modern decor, lobby is gorgeous! The staff was friendly, they don't go out of the way to speak to you, but when you ask them a question they are nice/helpful. Concierge gave us good recommendations. We were out in the city pretty much all day, so we didnt ask for much at the hotel, just towels, towels, and more towels. They were quick to bring up more. The 3rd day they brought us a ton of towels so we didnt need to call for more... lol. Quick check-out, clean rooms/bathroom. CONVENIENCE is the #1 reason to choose the hotel. Walking distance to Mag Mile, Grant/Millenium Parks, navy pier, Giordano's, CVS, connected to the downtown tunnel for quick meals. It was a block over from Michigan so we were close enough to get to everything yet away from the large crowds on the main strip. Cons - There was a pair of dirty socks left in the closet in plain sight, that the cleaning crew obviously missed... however the rest of the room was clean.  There are NO refrigerators in the room. Only the mini-bar fridge and you're charged $$ for putting any items in it.

It's a beautiful walk from this hotel to the river and other locations. Navy pier is a 20 minute walk. 2. The hotel is huge, could be a plus or minus for some, for me it didn't make a difference. 3. Extremely nice staff at check in 4. River view if you are on a high floor and if you get a room with a view (duh) 5. Could be great value if you get a low rate The bad: 1.  The person who designed the lay out of the bathroom should be fired. The toilet paper holder (w/ the toilet paper naturally) was behind the toilet. That was really annoying as you can imagine. The water pressure was bad. They had a curtain instead of a glass door in the shower. The sink was not comfortable to use. 2. Parking was extremely expensive - $50 per night. 3. No refrigerator. If you open the mini bar and take something out, even without opening it, you get charged because the bar is activated by a motion sensor. 4. Kind of felt like they nickled and dimed you for everything. 5. Bad TV channels, nothing to watch, no HBO. 6. The coffee shop down stairs was expensive, but I guess it's not the hotel's fault. 7. No pool. Overall, I am not sure if  I would have stayed here over another similar hotel in the same price range, but if the price was low I would stay here just because the location is so great.

I requested a non-smoking room.   I had gone online to use their concierge service which is supposed to be an easier way to request amenities.  We went to Chicago to celebrate my mom's 67th birthday so it as supposed to be an amazing experience! I ordered my mom a fruit basket for one of her surprises which she never got even after ordering it twice.  However, concierge did send her wine with chocolates for her birthday. And after the 2nd non receipt of my amenity for my mom they sent us three apples with a card congratulating me for my birthday! (rolls eyes) Before arriving to Chicago, I sent a request for dinner reservations at a great Mexican restaurant I got a phone call that their restaurants would be closed!! What the hell kind of shit is that? You are a hotel you don't close shit down when you have hotel guests in your hotel!! Ok fine the concierge was supposed to book me a reservation for 2 on my mom's birthday which was on the 24th of December, so I get a phone call from Dwayne saying that a lot of places were closed but he would try to find a place that was open.   I had checked with the concierge and that is when I found out that their restaurant was closed and that they had gotten us a reservation at Mexx. So we settled in and got ready for dinner.  We had a great dinner. However they had us down for dinner on Christmas day??!! Hmm...  Someone messed that up! Go figure! As with any information obtained from the concierge it was misinformation after misinformation! From where to find free Wi-Fi to where I could find some soul food!!  I was also told that I could not find food after midnight and that my only option was room service or the deli down in the lobby.  I didn't want either of those options! Pissed I called the front desk and told her that I wanted to transfer the room to my mom because I wanted to check out, she tried to counter act the misinformation about food access by telling me that there was definitely places that deliver to the hotel up until 5am but didn't seem phased that I wanted to leave.  Made me feel swell!!!!! Thank god I know people who live there and from there or I would have been stuck. The Room... We booked through Priceline. So I didn't pay that much per night, had I paid more I would have demanded a refund!!  It reeked of cigarette smoke and it took 2 days to go away.  The room had dust that covered some parts of the room was so thick I could write in it! The bathroom had chipped tile, a broken tub drain, and a loose screw that held the curtain rod to its hinges.   A little advice read all hotel reviews; call the hotel in advance to make sure they are 100% before booking!! And if you are unhappy with your room no matter how much you pay for it speak to a manger. I just don't understand why this hotel received 4 stars!!! It so does not deserve it.  The whole staff had no way to compensate for their lack of customer service skills and or their screw ups.  I didn't cause a scene because of my mom. Rest assured we won't ever stay in a Hyatt.  Priceline should know when a hotel is not 100% operational or is undergoing construction which is one of the excuses I heard from the front desk as to why there were putting us in a tower across the street.",1,0,0,0

The sad part is that the owners of Hyatt live in Chicago, so you'd think they would put more effort into this property but we have nicer Hyatt's in Colorado. I've stayed in a lot of the hotels around Michigan Ave and usually don't feel the need to write a review but last night's stay was ridiculous. The weather has been pretty brutal in Chicago and my apartment does not have central air, so I thought I would treat myself to a hotel for the night. Well I used Hotwire hoping I would get anything but this place, but that did not happen. I showed up around midnight because my girlfriend and I had been to the movies. Now I find sometimes if you get a really laid back night shift crew, they won't make you put down a credit card. I mean it's already midnight and checkout is at noon, why fill out more paperwork and hassle me with having to check that the ""authorization"" drops off. Well I guess this place thinks they're the W because they would not budge on a $50 authorization. $50 bucks!!! Even if I rockstar trashed the room, I'm so sure the $50 would cover it all. Oh well I let them authorize for $50 even though my room was pre-paid and then got offered a queen bed. Not okay. I can sleep on a king at home, I'm not paying to sleep on a queen. We finally compromise with a king on a smoking floor. I then asked if they knew of any late-night delivery open because I did not have my laptop to Grubhub something. The dude hands me a Sarpino's menu. WOW! The room was just what I had expected. Paper thin walls, rock hard bed and no wine glasses(just paper cups). Yeah, we got the longest bar in the country and you can't put real glasses in the room. To top it off, housekeeping woke me up at noon even though the privacy sign was up and the front desk said if I wanted to stay till 3 PM it would be 1/2 a night in price. No thank you!

So much walking just to get to your room. Anyways, the check in process was smooth and easy.  Great service.  Valet was expensive but that was expected so no surprise there. The day we left there was protesting done outside the hotel area so we had to go get our car from the valet garage... not really valet service.  On nicer days, it's  a good walk to the shops on Michigan Ave.  In the cold winter days, I would recommend bundling up or getting a taxi.  Overall, good hotel and location.  We always get a deal on priceline!",4,0,0,0

It is quite different at first -took me about a month to get the hang of it!  Since I was on my way to a work related event and we didn't know where else to park, this was our only option.  The attendant reassured me that they have had experience with my kind of car and I left it. When I got back, they had my car back to me within 5 minutes and it was all in one piece. I guess I have Ferris Bueller level paranoia! I would definitely trust this staff again with my car if I had to park in that area! Sometimes a little extra money is worth it if you know your car is in good hands!",4,0,0,0

The room looks worn and is not up to my standards for almost 200 a night. I ordered room service, and the food was good, but I had an issue with the service. I asked if the guy who brought it up if he had change, he said no. I gave him 40 for a $32.00 meal expecting him to return with my change but he never did.  Needless to say I am not pleased. And I also cannot seem to find any information in this hotel room on the amenities.

I suggest you call ahead like I did so they know you are coming early.The women at the desk was friendly and when I requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me ""I have a room on the 18th floor with a view of the river or you can go higher with no view"". I thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that I wouldn't get stuck with a room with a view of a wall.     The rooms are big (I had a doubles room) The beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. An Ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. Great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring Chicago. The view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries.     Another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. You simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. I had my boarding passes in about a minute. Came in handy when I got to OHare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers.

There's a Corner Bakery close to the hotel for breakfast (1 block). 3. A minute walk to major bus stops. 4. There's BIG BAR!!! (see my other review). 5. Room deco is minimal - no fancy stuff but it's very clean. 6. Millenium Park (a block), The Loop (about 3 blocks), and shopping area is a block. 7. There's a 24 hour deli which is a plus. Take note; 1. At first, I was disappointed because of the location. I wanted it to be noisy, crowded and a touristy area - maybe close to small restaurants etc. (Stay at The Loop Area or Magnificent Mile area if you prefer it that way). But it was a good decision after all. Wacker Road is a major road and it's very convenient when you are a tourist (bus stops). There's a BIG BAR open at night in the hotel and it's always crowded. I mean crowded until 2am everyday even on weekdays! 2. No free breakfast and internet. Complimentary coffee and tea though. 3. Employees are great and helpful. 4. Hotel lobby is not boutique style - it's actually convention/airport like atmosphere. Always crowded and noisy (lobby only) - the way I like. 5. Ok, just one thing... if people are talking on the hallway, it echoes to your room - I think it's an acoustical thing. It happens when we arrived there at about 10am.

The first time was last summer: I'd scored a room for my mom (she was visiting me for my b-day) for only $100 on hotwire during the first week of June. I was really looking forward to hanging out at the hotel with my mom and just absorbing the atmosphere there. Unfortunately for my mom, my dad was being an idiot that weekend, so she couldn't make it for the night. She told me I could have the room and then called them to let them know I'd be taking over the reservation. They were really nice about it and didn't give me any hassle. One of my friends was in town early to visit and so we both ended up taking the room (neener to my bf, who didn't get to come). My mom was really nice and let us order a glass of wine (each) close to midnight (which would begin my 23rd birthday). I took it as a good sign when our total came out to $23 and some change. We had a wonderful time dancing around our room celebrating my birthday. The room was really nice and we both enjoyed the iHome they provide. Did I mention the view of the river was fantastic? A wonderful start to my 23rd year of life. My second experience was last fall when my best friend chose the Hyatt to spend her bachelorette party night at. Upon my arrival I was hassled by a rude member of the concierge because I couldn't remember the bride's room number and they wouldn't give it to me because I ""wasn't on the list"" of the room guests. Not really a big deal-I know they're not supposed to give out room numbers anymore. So I stood there for a few minutes while I waited for a response text from the matron of honor. I got it, announced to her the room number and a ""thanks for nothing!"" (rude, I know, but so was she), and I was up the elevator, lickety-split. The room was the same as the one I'd shared with my friend for my b-day back in the summer-double bed with an iHome. I got there early and in order to commemorate the  occasion (bachelorette party), they actually sent us (free of charge) a bottle of champagne, 4 chocolate covered strawberries, and some chocolate covered biscuits. Score! It was so nice of them. We had a nice night there. Hung out in the cool bar after getting back from the festivities, walked around the hotel, and finally went to bed around 3am.

It was on the upper floors and had a spectacular view of the Chicago River and the Wrigley Building across the river.

The bathroom was of a good size also. Unfort I did not get a room of a view of the lake but that was ok as the room over all was nice. This is a HUGE hotel that many conventions use to host the events and the guests. It is a bit impersonal compared to the boutique hotels that I have stayed at in Chicago and else where but what it really boils down to is: are the rooms and hotel well maintained and clean and do I feel safe.

Basically, it offers the most luxurious rooms you will ever experience anywhere, and saying you get much more than you pay for is an understatement. Thick, soft pillow top beds, Oreck air purifiers with ionizer and fragrance inserts, ipod docking station, 5-disc cd changer, large-screen tv, fresh tulips, white callas, or some other exotic variety of long-stem flower in a crystal vase in your room daily, solid cherrywood furniture, brass desk lamps, memory foam pillows with extra pillows and blanket in the closet, 600 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets and comforter that feel like silk against the skin, and the bathrooms...aaaaahh...no expense spared on anything! The layout of the rooms represents a perfect melding of design, aesthetics, and  function.   I have ABSOLUTELY no complaints or disappointments, and that says a lot because I am one picky bastard. Expect rooms to run about $180-237 per night. Also, when you're confirming your reservation, ask for a complementary upgrade to a king on the Regency Club level floor (this is the limited access uppermost penthouse floor). If you're lucky, one will be available at no extra charge and you will be privy to one of the best views of Chicago. This is one of the few hotels that will make you feel guilty upon check-out and as you settle your bill...knowing you would have gladly paid $200-300 more a night for the kind of luxury you enjoyed during your stay.   I can go on and on about the Hyatt, but  I will stop here because the 4-star+ ratings already speak to how amazing your stay will be. RECOMMENDATION: YES...DO the Hyatt Regency EVERY CHANCE YOU GET! Special occasions, for a weekend of downtown partying, whatever excuse you can think up to get you there! Get a king room on one of the upper floors (if you can, do the Regency Club level...there is no better view of the city). Try their website's special promotions when you're booking first, but if you're only seeing $200+, then hit Priceline or Hotwire...they tend to have the best deals for all of the nicer Chicago-area hotels. I also suggest parking your car in the garage about a block away (can't think of the name of the street for sure...but just off Wacker and Columbus Dr..by the bridge). That garage is not affiliated with the Hyatt, but only charges $26 a day.  If you do Hyatt's parking/valet service, expect about $46 (after taxes) a day with in/out privilege. I know...OUCH! ...but hey...it's Chicago. Also: Lobby level floor...huge open restaurant, lower-lobby level...bar/lounge area where drinks are served in the evenings. You will also find the Hard Drive nightclub here, which is situated in the middle of a fountain/pool...so surrounded by water. Check out pics. DISCLAIMER: My experience is limited to the Regency Club penthouse level, however, I had many friends stay in regular king rooms and reported experiences similiar to my own.",5,0,0,0
4210,pyHPjmasF33b5CvL7vQkdQ,"I attended a conference in Chicago last year and the Hyatt was one of the conference hotels. Because of the Hyatt name, there was no decision to make; of course, I would stay at the Hyatt. When we arrived, check in was easy and the staff offered us the opportunity to upgrade our room to a Deluxe room. At only $15.00 more night, I thought the amenities definitely sounded worth it. When I initially entered my room, I was impressed by the design and concept. It had an Oriental feel to it and reminded me of some of the boutique type hotels I have stayed in the past. I noticed on the surface that the room was rather dirty. When I sat down at the desk, the leather placemat was very sticky. On the bathroom vanity, there were numerous soap type stains. I was able to easy rub them off with a damp washcloth. The walls were dirty, both in the bathroom and bedroom. Both the carpet and the bedspread on my bed had cigarette burns on them. This was rather surprising since I was in a non-smoking room. The carpet was more understandable, but I was surprised that a bedspread with two burns on it would be used. I also noticed that the ""plush bathrobes"" promised by the check-in staff was not in the room. I called to have a robe delivered and when I put it on the next morning, it had a big rip in the front of it. I had dinner out, came back to the room and put on my pajamas. I was a bit disappointed that we did not get the ""turn down service"" we were promised. It something I enjoy while traveling and makes me feel a bit pampered. I pulled back the bedspread and noticed much debris on the sheet. Initially, I tried to brush the sheet off, but on further inspection, I noticed there were at least five hairs on the sheets. It was really disgusting. I did contact housekeeping and the sheets were changed by a very nice woman named Sarah. She did have much difficulty finding sheets that were not torn. After 20 minutes, I told her I didn't care if they were torn; I just wanted them to be clean. She did replace the burnt bedspread and apologized that it was used. I also did not receive the daily newspaper. I did call and re-request the turndown service the next night; I received it on night #2, but not #3. I suppose overall I was very disappointed by the room that I received. I did call to complain several times (robe, turn down service, dirty sheets) but no one seemed too concerned about me. I don't know if I should have pursued it more while I was there, I felt like I was being too picky, but when I got home, my husband thought the room sounded terrible.",1,0,0,0
4211,Dq9b7ePbuhDSToVSIr10Qw,"I actually travel a lot internationally for work so I've stayed in my fair share of hotels & can without a doubt say this is the WORST business floor accommodations I have ever stayed on.  I'm not even sure where to start... My reservations were for the Regency Club floor, two double beds because I was traveling with my dad.  My dad arrived prior to me & I had asked that they let him check in.  He was told there were no rooms with double beds & was moved to a suite with a king bed on the 21st floor & they would gladly give us a roll away bed for free.   When I got to the hotel I told them this wouldn't do I wasn't paying good money to sleep on a roll away bed or not be able to use the amenities of the Regency Club which I was paying for.  They were quick to move us to another room back on the Regency Club level.   I have stayed numerous times on the business floors at the Shangri-La in APAC so I guess I had my expectations set too high.  If anything the Hyatt should go take a class from the Shangri-la when they open in Chicago on how to run a business floor.  Anyway I expected a nice sized room with additional amenities, such as slippers, free internet access, & a nice selection of teas &/or coffee.  The only thing I can say nice about our room was the view.   Let's start in the entrance; there was a closet right when we entered the room however the lighting stunk so you couldn't really see anything in the closet & no slippers.   Next the bathroom, this has got to be the WORST hotel bathroom I have ever seen.  The toilet was like a public restroom & the bar to flush was up under the vanity. When you flushed it, it sounded like a 747 was coming through the wall.  The wall paper in the bathroom was coming off the wall & there were no extra amenities that I have gotten at other hotels on the business floor, such as nail clippers, razor, toothbrush etc.  I am paying good money to stay on this floor & didn't just upgrade when I checked in.  There was 1 bathrobe on the back of the door that I guess all of us are supposed to share.  The hairdryer was a piece of crap that if you used longer than 90 seconds on high it would overheat so to blow dry your hair you had to allow at least 30 minutes of going back & forth waiting for it to cool down.  Now lets continue on to the main bedroom.  The beds were nice & had nice down comforters on them the pillows were great & there were 4 on each bed with one in the closet.  The TV sucked the remote control would only work from one exact location in the room which of course wasn't where you were sitting in your bed.  I was floored to find out we didn't have free internet access in our rooms like many other hotels offer business floor guests.  (I did pay extra for this room right????) We stayed 4 nights at the hotel & only received turn down service two of the 4 nights.  Some days we would only get 1 coffee refill for our coffee pot & other days we would get two.  Some days we would get 1 new washcloth some days we would get three.  It was like playing a game of craps.  The only thing that seemed consistent was the morning paper.   Now let's move on to the Regency Club which offers free continental breakfast, snacks throughout the day, cocktail hour & desert hour.  Breakfast was ok the set up of the room is just terrible they toss a bucket of ice in the bar sink & toss in some yogurts & the milk & juice.  There is 1 trash can in the entire room & you get to drink your coffee from a paper cup.  I thought they would at least have a hot pot or two with oatmeal & some other hot items like MOST business floors do.  Nope... you get your choice of pastries, fresh fruit & little individual boxed cereals.  Not my idea of a great continental breakfast.  I've actually had better at a Holiday Inn.   Cocktail hour this was my favorite... at most hotel when you stay on the business floor they have complimentary cocktails & appetizers for a few hours every evening.  While the appetizers were great the beverage service stunk.  It was a serve yourself honor system $6.50 for a beer & $5.00 for some wine & oh yeah pour it yourself.  Don't have cash then please fill out a card with your room number & we will just charge your room.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I'm still at this point trying to figure out what the hell we paid extra to stay on this floor.  At this point I've vowed to stay at the Shangri-la next time I'm in Chicago (opens 2009).  Desert hour was ok it's from 8:30-9:30 & was different every night.  Cheesecake, carrot cake, brownies, clairs. I guess all I can say is if you have never stayed on a nice business floor at a really nice hotel then you will be fine staying on the Regency Club Level.  If you have stayed in some really nice hotels with really nice amenities then you are bound to be disappointed with your experience at the Hyatt.  I would highly recommend not upgrading to the Regency Club it's definitely NOT WORTH the extra money.",3,0,0,0

The room we stayed in was very nice, the view was not diserable but the comfy king size bed and flat screen TV made up for it.   I loved having the ipod docking station in the room as well.   We got to the hotel well before check in time and were allowed to keep our luggage in storage until we checked.  It was a smooth easy check in. I will tell you, it was a very very busy hotel with lots of people.  There were over 1600 people checking out on Sunday.  So if you like quiet hotels do not stay here!

4219,x8gkUvXMt9ros2G9n72,"I guess it all depends on your expectations from hotels and what tickles you in that category. I'm pretty picky and I like hotels that are new, innovative, stylish and really go out of their way to make you comfortable. So based on my pickiness, adjust the star rating! Parking: This one just flat out pissed me off. I don't mind paying for quality but getting ripped off is a diff story. So they only offer Valet at $50 per day. I should have the choice to park my own car if I want to in a hotel that has two towers on two side of the street and has more than enough parking space to accommodate valet and self park. When you ask the hotel staff for alternate parking info, the response is ""we don't know of any other parking available"" which is BS. You live and work in Chicago and don't know of other parking lots? Good thing I live in Chicago too and know that the whole area underneath the hotel, the park and some of the surrounding is all multi-level underground parking. Again, being ripped off! So don't get ripped off, if you don't mind a 5-10min walk. Directly next to the hotel's parking on the lower level, you can park for $7 overnight as long as you enter between 3-6pm and leave by 8am. I went in after 6pm so they said it would be $13 as long as I left before 8am. At the end, I decided to just stay in bed so I paid $30 for 24hr period which is still better than $50 in a getting ripped off fashion. In the winter months, that might not be the best choice. Also if you're planning on going in and out, then you might just let them rip you off! Overall: I'd stay here again if I didn't have other choices or if I happen to get it on priceline/hotwire. The lobby is spacious but my favorite feature of the lobby which is the big bar on the front desk floor, is closed during the day!!!!! I'm not a big drinker but I'd much rather sit at that big bar and have lunch! It's amazing how some hotels limit the use of their best feature....maybe they just don't see that as their best feature, who knows. Rooms: I had a junior suite so my room was fairly large with a king bed, desk, very large bathroom, sectional couch and a wet bar. With all that space, I had a tiny tall window which was ceiling to floor but very narrow! The bathroom was large but I just didn't like the quality. It was somewhat older, shower head was one of those ""I can do 15 sprays but they all suck"" type of shower-heads and amazingly, as large as the bathroom was, most of it was wasted space b/c I didn't even have enough counter space to put my stuff out. Good thing there wasn't a lady with me or I would have had to make her use the wet bar for her space needs lol. Yeah right, I'd probably end up using the closet while she uses the bathroom and the wet bar! Thermostat: I'm not sure what the thermostat in the room did but it definitely didn't control the temp lol I put it on all kinds of numbers and used diff fan speeds but I was either getting frost bites or feeling like I was in a sauna. They also have an A/C vent directly above the bed to blow on you as you sleep so you wake up with frozen sinuses! Smart. Staff: Very friendly, very professional Price: When I look at their regular prices, all I think in my head is ""are you kidding me?"" I would never pay that kind of money for a hotel like this. If you're not picky about amenities and their quality the way I am, then this hotel might be a good option. It's right in the middle of everything so if you're in town with family but on business, you can take a smelly cab to the loop while your family enjoys MI Ave., Navy Pier, Grant/Millenium Park all within walking distance.

I attended the NYE 2009 bash at the hotel and let me tell you, it was a bash and a half. I went with a bunch of friends and we ended up getting three rooms total and all of the rooms were incredibly nice, big flat screens, ipod docks, granite counters in the bathroom, great views, etc. The party allegedly had 2000 people attending but the Hyatt was definitely ready for everyone, checking in was a breeze, and they gave us our three rooms all on the same floor, which was a total perk. The party was a blast - the top level was the band and it had lots of light, and the second level was much more dark, clubby, and had a DJ. I would HIGHLY recommend if you attend the shindig next year to get to the party as early as you can because finding seats to eat was a struggle. Partially because we had a large group but that was pretty much the only negative for the party. You occasionally had to wait a long time for a drink but almost every bartender handed them out two at a time and they were all strong. The party was a huge success, the hotel was beautiful, and everyone had a great time. HOWEVER - upon checking out the next day and heading back to the burbs, I realized that I had left something in the room. Right around the same time, my friend called and told me she had left something in her room too. OK partially our faults because hey, check and make sure you have all your stuff. So I called and talked to the Lost and Found department and they told me they'd look for it and get back to me. They didn't get back to me. I called the next day. They said they still hadn't found it but that doesn't mean that it had not shown up. My friend stopped by the next day. They didn't have either thing. I have called about every other day for almost two weeks now and neither of our items have shown up. Their voice mail message says they will call you back in 24 hours and I've probably left four messages and gotten one call back. I just think it's insane that they have a designated lost and found department ... employees whose ENTIRE job is recovering guest's lost items... and they haven't found either item OR gotten back to us about our lost stuff. So that really negatively affects my overall Hyatt experience, sadly. I understand that NYE was really busy and a lot of people probably left stuff but I have called multiple times and they are well aware of me and what I am looking for.... how could they have not found either thing, almost two weeks later?

If it's not an NBC Universal company station, Disney or ESPN, they don't have it. Which I found to be ridiculous. It happened to be the night of the season premiere of a show I was looking forward to watching snuggled down in bed and watch...but they didn't have the channel. And it wasn't some arcane channel....it was MTV (yeah, I know....I'm ashamed, but I was on vacation and the Hills is a guilty pleasure, OK?) So...no hills....no hot soak because the tub was so incredibly gross. toilet didn't flush.... Also, with what you pay per night, would free Internet be too much to ask? Or perhaps something less than the 14 or so it was for 24 hours? I can't believe that a huge hotel would consistently nickel and dime you like that. As for the positives: I will say the bed was great- nothing beats a down comforter and the feather pillows were nice. as was the lavender citrus lotion/shampoo. But this hotel..I'm incredulous that someone would pay full price for. No one greets you as you enter....no one asked how my stay was (save for the fellow who hailed me a taxi and was the only person who treated me as a paying customer) I will never come back to this hotel ever. I'm better off paying slightly more for an antiquated 1960's motel.",1,0,0,0

Guest are treated like cattle and nickel-and-dimed. Unbelievable. You'd think in this economy they'd actually try to win/keep customers. The Hyatt charges $250+ a night then has the nerve to charge another $15+ for Internet use (PER PERSON in the same room!), and the rooms aren't even that nice - there was actually construction going on in some places. What is shocking is how people put up with this crap  - they must not know better.  When I was unable to find a place to sit down and eat lunch at the main bar/restaurant during lunch (the place was packed for a trade show/conference) I noticed a bunch of tables that were blocked off. I asked if our party could sit at one of these tables. The answer was no, they are not open until later. Are you kidding me? And forget about using your cell phone in the main conference rooms - they won't work. Amazing.  I checked out after one night, went around the block and found a nicer hotel at a third of the price that offered free wireless (even free access to desktop computers in the lobby so you can print your tickets prior to departing), unlimited bottled water and had superior service - like they actually cared about their customers.

The bathtub drain didn't work! I had to unscrew the drain and started pulled out hair and a sponge clogging the drain. GROSS. I saw a bandaid in the drain too, but I didn't bother going any further. But worst of all, the maid knew the drain was clogged. When we returned to the room, I noticed the drain was unscrewed and left in the bathtub; we had left it screwed into the bathtub. So I thought, ""Oh good, the maid unclogged the drain."" WRONG. If it wasn't for the location and excellent service right outside the hotel, I would give this hotel two stars. The front door guys are very helpful with directions. They also recognized after our second trip to the hotel, and they always hit the open door button for us. That's service.

It was difficult to get in and out of to close the door, and there was no good place to put wet towels after our showers. I'm smaller than an average size woman, and I had some trouble maneuvering. The updates that were done to the bathroom did give it nice modern appeal. Toilets and shower were extremely noisy. The middle of the night bathroom trip could have woken the dead from their slumber! Room: Decent size room for the price. We were told we had a queen bed, but ti felt a little snug for a queen. The bed sunk in the middle a little bit (I would assume with a bed that size that typically only one person would sleep in it at a time). Linens were comfortable and enough pillows. Decor was nice and looked as if it had been recently updated. I liked the modern color scheme. The wallpaper on the walls was peeling in multiple places. Seems like such an easy fix that just wasn't done. Location: Just a few blocks away from Millennium Park and Grand Park, steps away from all color el stations and a block away from State Street shopping. I have no complaints with it! We actually walked almost everywhere the whole weekend because of the nice weather. Overall, the hotel itself was beautiful. I wished they would have cranked up the AC a little bit more in their common areas with the highs in the mid to upper 90s in Chicago. And their lobby is on the second floor which I found to be strange and somewhat frustrating as the signage wasn't terrific when we were checking after walking with bags on a warm day. Plenty of elevators (they are split in sections of rooms which was nice for a building that size - never waited more than 60 seconds). All common areas were neat and clean, the staff we did encounter was quite pleasant. Worth the money we spent on a hotwire deal, but I'd never pay full price for this place!",4,1,0,0
4275,-PxjVc3iFin8nsUoOBTCqA,"The s/o and I made the Palmer House our home during our week long vacation in Chicago and although we only stayed for a week, it was difficult to leave behind...Chicago and the Palmer House! Location was key for the both of us as it would be our first domestic vacation where we relied solely on public transit.  With that said, the PH was just around the corner from the Red line and one block away from the Blue line which can take you to O'Hare...saving you lots of money on cab fare! Stepping into the hotel was a little was odd as it was a cold, stale looking interior until we took the escalator up to the lobby where a ceiling mural of luxurious art greeted us; eat your heart out Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.  The lobby alone was rich in history and grandeur.  Check in was quick and friendly. There was just one elevator bank with eight cars, unless you were staying in the Executive floor and you had your own exclusive elevators to use.  Our room was located on the 8th floor, where the fitness center was located as well.  The room was of decent size and the decor although fairly newer, was kept in style of the hotel.  The bathroom was very small, but functional.  It could've used some ventilation system as it would get quite steamy during a hot shower so, we had to always prop the door open.  The room had a walk in closet and safe big enough to hold a laptop. However, our room did have a connecting door to each room on both sides of us.  One night, we could hear deafening cries from an infant in the room next to us.  I wanted to complain but I felt sorry for the parent who had to deal with it.  Then on the Friday night, we could hear music radiating  from the Ballroom (not sure how many floors below us) for a wedding or something.  But all things considered, noise wise, I would consider ourselves majorly lucky as we were placed in a room facing other rooms (Imagine a ""U"" shape, we were on one side of the ""U""), otherwise we would be hearing cars and the above ground train on Wabash. A couple other pros I should mention was the HSIA was complimentary, which is pretty rare for full service hotels, not to mention, the signal strength was excellent. The other pro was having a Starbucks on the ground floor. Overall, our stay was very pleasant and made our trip to Chicago totally enjoyable knowing we had a comfortable room and cozy bed in an amazing hotel!  Chicago was an awesome city and when we come back, we're staying at the PH again!",4,2,0,0

We had scored a great deal on an Orbitz-type site so we decided to take a mini-trip with two kids (ages 10,12) to The Palmer House. Everyone here mentioned the ""wow"" factor of the lobby, which was lovely. But, the room, the view and the bathrooms were surprisingly ho-hum. Our 10th floor room overlooked a fire escape and the metal sides and roof of the pool. We couldn't see the street at all. The bathroom-aside from a posh sink-was similar to my grandma's. (No offense, grandma) Very old-school 1950's with old tile that needed a good scrubbing, old tub, very small. The indoor pool is small but it has a deep end that went to 8 feet and a hot tub, which the kids loved. We basically had it to ourselves at 5 pm, but by 9:00 in the morning it was near capacity. The only other thing we didn't like was the maid knocking on our door at 8:00 a.m. to ask if we were leaving yet. We said, ""No, check out isn't until noon so we planned to stay until then.""

4279,RxP7MH5HEevk,"Attn: Mr. Todd Temperly What happened to the GOOD OLD DAYS?  When Hospitality meant something... When you call yourself ""THE Palmer House"" you are creating a allegiance to your brand.  You are failing to live up to the brand that was built for you many decades ago.  The fact that movies stars of years past would flock to your hotel simply based on the name and the brand that was built on SUPERIOR HOSPITALITY.  The hospitality recevied by those customer is absolutly a thing of the past.  Unfortunately, you have failed miserably to accomplish anything other than outstanding luggage service.  What a shame?  You are actually calling yourself, ""THE Palmer House"".  Boo Woo Woo, you are embarassing THE CITY OF CHICAGO. Just a note on how our company's corporate travel policy works.  Each week we are assigned a client to visit for 5 days.  We're generally given notice sometimes 3 days, sometimes 5 to7  days and sometimes weeks in advance notice. We're given a budget for just about everything, air, hotel and car + a daily food allowance and other incidentals like dry cleaning, fuel etc.  As contractors WE HAVE A CHOICE!!!!  The key is to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience for yourself in your home away from home. I am a contract technical trainer for a company that employs 15,000 other contract trainers.  (Notice no large caps in titling as it is not that important to me.  The important thing is to get the job done, and I am proud to say we do that!!)  In the 18 months of nonstop travel week to week all across the country I have only experienced the feeling of being so belittled and unwelcomed by a hotelier in the hospitality industry one other time and they will not get my repeat business either. It is a shame that I would have to interact with your hotel front desk via phone and front desk managers via phone and in person (Kim over the phone and Vera in person)  5 times and miss my check in and revise the reservation 3 times to accommodate your staff in the handling of a corporate preauthorization to pay for my stay (at your oh so fabulous facility).   When I told the front desk manager to note that I would pay for the first night or two out of my pocket was a moment of insanity for me.  After experiencing this cavalier attitude in person, I recall that I HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE.  Thank Goodness for that.   Thank you for giving me the OPTION TO CHOOSE!!!  I'll work as diligently as I can to stick with my normal policy of patronizing the local boutique hotels who live and die by their level of hospitality.  For example Kimpton Properties, YOU ROCK!!!     Vera, your front desk manager was so arrogant as to tell me she would have been doing me a favor in accepting the preauthorization.  However, as she put it, she couldn't even accept the preauthorization from me because it wasn't on 'your form' and the form wasn't turned in 1 week in advance of my stay.   I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a professional busines traveler and you don't work with business travelers. I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a woman busines traveler and you don't work with women business travelers. I don't know if it's because I'm a human being with a heart and soul that should be treated with courteousy and respect, an you don't work with human beings. I don't know if it's because I'm a black travelers, and you don't work with black travelers. The Palmer House is definitely not my kind of place.  Your staff is cold, cavalier and fails to provide a business class of professional hospitality.   Good Luck!!! cc: Hilton Corporate HQ 7930 Jones Branch Drive McLean, Virginia 22102  USA cc:Yelp.com",1,1,0,2

You walk into the hotel and the lobby is gorgeous, with an outstanding bar area and shopping area downstairs. However, after my 2 days I have to say my stay was completely miserable and at least Chicago had enough to offer to save my trip. The rooms are tiny and whoever came up with the design to put the tv at a 90 degree angle to the bed wasn't thinking very clearly. The bed was apparently a king, but definitely felt more like a queen. Now, a small room with a strange design doesn't get you 1 star, but watching an inch long cockroach walk around your bathroom at 7am in the morning after you wake up tends to ruin an experience. After spending 5 minutes smashing it with a metal trash can and STILL not fully killing it, your day just can never be the same. I went to the front desk before leaving for my business conference and the front desk person said that they would have a technician check the room for holes / infestations and would get me a new room set up. When I came back from work, the front desk had no record of me ever filing the complaint and no record of there being a cockroach in the room. So I had to retell my story and show them the picture of the massive insect. What scares me the most, is that how can you let a possible infestation just leak through the records? What if it was bed bugs (which if you google the hotel, clearly they have had issues) or something nastier than a cockroach? The front desk person went back into their managers area (for 15 minutes I was standing there waiting) and came back to let me know they had given me a new room further away from the elevator (as if that somehow means less chance of bugs or something) and 50 bucks in food coupons which only work at this EXACT hotel. The new room was nice and spacious, with a great view of the ventilation system on the 8th floor and a wall blocking anything else. To finish it off, I woke up the next morning with hives, either from something in the sheets or due to stress (I wonder what could have stressed me out). I literally and figuratively am allergic to the hotel. The rooms have nice amenities, but it can not hide the fact that the infrastructure is old and needs much better maintenance. The lack of customer service and hospitality, after knowing that I dealt with a miserable morning was also saddening. No way I will be spending another trip at the Palmer House.",1,3,0,2

The hallways of the rooms promintently display black-and-white photos of the stars of the ""golden age"" - singers, musicians, actors of all kinds grace the silent hallways. There appears to have been some renovation based on other reviews and the curtains of other rooms I noticed from my window.  My room on the 17th floor was quite lovely - art deco furniture, lovely colors, ""Hollywood-style"" decorative bathroom and closet door handles were a reminder of a past golden age. A few minor annoyances - no coffee maker in my room (big, huge boo for a business traveler.)  The buttons on the phone didn't connect to... well, anywhere (wake up calls, etc.) No free internet except in the lobby (which seems to be pretty typical these days.)  The instructions for the check out process are incorrect and you can't set a time for checkout.  So, I accidentally checked out when I wasn't ready to leave for a few hours (in conference meetings all morning.)  The phone operator didn't understand this predicament and kept forwarding me to non-answering numbers.

The very cool and detached attitude by the staff left me nervous that my older/international guests would have problems with the impersonal service or that the end of my stay would be marred by a billing problem . We booked 5 rooms for myself and my wedding party and our guests booked another 6-7 rooms. When we booked and paid for the 5 rooms, I asked if any of the rooms had  a mini-fridge (for my cake) and the front desk agent looked past me and said, ""no that's an extra $40/night""  After spending $2500, I felt a little put out.  Later, I was checking a room quote for a friend and noticed that the rate for an executive level room was just $15 more a night. I wrote the concierge and asked if I could upgrade. I was initially told that I would have to pay an extra $40 to upgrade. Unless of course I cancelled and re-booked. I had to write 3 emails to get a response to this. I would have paid for upgrades for all the rooms at $15, but that was not an option. The final resolution was a free upgrade for myself and the assurance that the concierge was available to handle any needs I had.   I needed to change the names on a couple rooms and each time I called the Front Desk, I was on hold for 20 minutes.  Each conversation started witht he agent telling me they couldn't change it because I booked it elsewhere, then I would insist that I confirmed and PAID at the Palmer directly, more time on hold, and then changing the name. Finally, I emailed a list of guests to the concierge a couple days before the event, in case people got lost or had a problem with their reservation. It was met with radio silence.

At check-in, I was lucky enough to be helped by an arrogant, entitled gentleman who didn't find it worthy of his time to share with me how I could find my room, where the pool was or even how to access the elevators. I couldn't even get the jerk to smile.  I didn't think much of it until I was checking out (more on that later) and heard another staff member graciously and cheerfully speak to patrons. Now, I have a lot of respect for housekeeping staff. They undoubtedly work very hard... but what I did not appreciate was 1) how late the rooms would be cleaned. I got back to my room at 4pm once and it was still in the state that I left it in 2) when I would leave my room in the mornings, how my housekeeper would ask me if I wanted my room cleaned. When I answered yes, she had to make sure I was certain of my decision and would then be disappointed. What the hell?! I get that it would be nice to have one less room to clean, but isn't that your job? 3) noisy and inconsiderate staff. Because the walls are paper thin at this hotel, I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the next room.... including the HUGE fuss the staff made about the room next door... at 7:30AM!!!!!!! Apparently, when my neighbors checked out of their room, they left behind quite a bit of broken glass and furniture. The staff cleaning up IN the room thought it appropriate to YELL OUT to other team members down the hall to come see the wreckage. I could distinctly hear the chatter, the furniture being moved around and even the noise coming from their walkie-talkies.... all at such an ungodly hour. Unforgivable. Plumbing was a nightmare. Not only was the flow from the shower head poor, but, if a housekeeper was cleaning next door and turned on the water there, my water pressure got even lower!!!! Did I mention that the bathroom is tiny?! Don't rock back and forth as you brush your teeth - you might just fall into the toilet! So here's my biggest gripe....an hour before check-out, I review my invoice and there's clearly an erroneous charge. I never dined in the hotel's restaurant. I try reaching the front desk SIX TIMES and no answer. I ask concierge to connect me and still no answer. Finally, 15 minutes later, I try again and get a live person on the phone. I explain that I never dined at the restaurant. No problem, he says, he'll remove the charge. Says I need to come down to pick up a new invoice.  I gather my belongings, head downstairs. A new staff member prints out my invoice and the charge is still there. I contest it and make reference to my call earlier. This dude says that there's nothing that can be done. In fact, because I didn't get the name of the person who said he'd waive it, I'm stuck. The charge needs to be ""investigated"". So hold on... I just spent over $900 staying at your hotel and you're gonna squabble with me for $17?!  Of course, I asked to speak to the manager. So Ms. Rasha comes out and says I should go home. If the charge isn't legit, she'll credit my account. I tell her that's not going to fly with me. This is my company card and each charge needs to be substantiated. I know I didn't dine at the restaurant in the hotel. IN FACT, I wasn't even at the hotel at 9:30pm last night. So she tells me, that 9:30pm must have been when the charge posted, I must have eaten there earlier and just simply forgot. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!? I tell her no, I haven't dined at their restaurant PERIOD. She offers to go through last night's receipts and get this, if the name on the receipt matches mine, I have to pay for the dinner. Why would I try to get out of a $17 charge if I had actually authorized it?!  She says to come back after 30 minutes. I go back after 45 minutes, and a new staff member tells me she's still looking through receipts. Fine. I go make myself useful and come back 25 minutes later.  The new staff member goes into Rasha's office, comes out, and prints me a new invoice without the charge. No explanation. No apology. Nothing.  I asked her what happened and she says ""The manager removed the charge. It was posted to the wrong room.""   Does the manager not know anything about customer service? Does she not have the human decency to come out and tell me this in person after she had me wait over an hour?  I ask her to call out Rasha and the latter comes out with an indignant look on her face. I tell her that I'm appalled by her customer service and thank her for inconveniencing me. Her reply? ""You're welcome"".",1,4,1,1

But the helpful pre-recorded message assures me that the restaurant downstairs, Lockwood, would definitely be able to help me!  I call Lockwood.  The chick on the phone says ""yep, come on down and get your coffee here"".  Oh, OK thanks, but I can just go to Starbucks for that?  Why would you have any service unavailable at the same time you have people checking in?   And speaking of the room.  I was ""upgraded"" because of the mix up at check in. My upgrade was to a small room that would have been beautifully decorated in 1990, complete with a large armoire that held a tube TV.  My view was of a fire escape (and most likely the alley below but I was too high up to see that far down.) Quite a bit different than the rooms they promote on the website.   I decide to check out the fitness center.  This is on a lower level, but when the elevator doors opened you would think you were in a completely different hotel.  Beautiful, modern decor in chocolate, greens and peacock blue.  The fitness center looks like a spa from the outside.  There is a woman at a desk who asks you to sign in.  Just as my pen hovered over the paper she adds ""Oh and by the way there is a $10 charge per day to use the facilities"".  Wait...what?  Are you serious?  Gah!  No thanks.   I just feel like my entire stay was non-stop irritation.  Are hotels the new airlines where the idea of service is dead and you are nickel and dimed to death?  I guess so, at least in the Palmer House.  Such a very serious let down.",2,6,2,1

I paid a pre-negotiated rate for $85 and never was I treated like someone who paid a negotiated rate. I took advantage of an upgrade to a double room in the executive suite on floor 23 for an additional $55. The room was wonderful. I am a HUGE fan of two beds/two baths. The room had two closets, safe, bathrobes, a flat screen and IPOD clock. Amazing showers and pressures. The beds were very comfortable. The only thing that could have made the room better was free wifi.... HOWEVER on the exec floor there were computers available. Also on the exec floor was a bartender, free non alcoholic beverages, snacks, appetizers, and breakfast. The parking is ridiculous but we paid overnight parking up the street for $12. The hotel is next door to Miller Pub which had great food for the value and a wider variety than I thought for pub food. Location.....wonderful for sites and shopping.

4302,Z5TMUHIT3-WZqCR-xAIEDA,"Giving this hotel only two stars breaks my heart. I have a big old soft spot for the Palmer House, as it was the hotel I stayed in on my first trip to Chicago nearly 20 years ago. Back then I thought it was the most luxurious hotel in the world and will always remember that trip fondly. So I was excited to go back, and there were elements of my stay that lived up to my great memories. Fabulous location. Gorgeous lobby and common areas. Unfailingly polite and cheerful service from check-in to room service to housekeeping. Good-sized, relatively quiet room on a high floor. Nice lounge with tasty drink selections. Three big disappointments, though: 1. My room, albeit spacious, was tired and dated. I was surprised at how annoying it was to have an old tube TV stashed away in an inconvenient armoire instead of a flat screen on a more accessible bureau-top. 2. Hotel wireless was expensive and slow. I don't mind paying extra for premium wireless service, provided I actually GET premium wireless service. But I didn't see any real difference in what I got for my $19.99 at the Palmer House than I would for free at any Courtyard by Marriott. 3. But the real reason for the two-star review: My bathtub was a deathtrap. I am not kidding. The liner had separated from the tub frame and was all warped and spongy, so every morning it felt like I was taking a shower on a trampoline. It kept me so off balance I had to shampoo with one hand while clinging to the soap dish with the other. I could not imagine being an elderly person trying to navigate that dangerous enclosure. It's a wonder someone has not fallen, broken a hip, and sued them. My colleague, who has more Hilton points than I, stayed on one of the renovated floors and told me his room was really nice. He also snuck me into the concierge lounge, which was very comfortable and served up great wines and tasty hot and cold appetizers. So maybe the moral of the story is...stay at the Palmer House but on a concierge floor. That's a solution I could live with.",2,1,2,0

The open sitting area near the bar is comfortable and welcoming. There are bar tables off to one side with iPad's in upright holders, for anyone's entertainment. Bonus...they lowered their valet prices, which is nice, since the hotel rooms are quite pricey. At least you don't have to take it up the yin yang from all directions.

It was my first time negotiating on Priceline, and I believed it to be a great deal on a long Summer weekend that would get me out of Cedar Rapids.  The Palmer House proved to be a great experience, and not just because its a Hilton either. After doing some research I found there was certainly some history to the location, and I have to mention that they have done a decent job at preserving it. I was given a room clearly meant for one person, partly because I told them it was just me and also because I didn't mind not getting extra space. My first thought after entering the room was more a long the lines of ""This is the most perfect 1 bedroom you could find""! One could argue that another perspective would be- ""This is an extra store room""! Don't get me wrong, it was a small room that I greatly admired...clearly for one person. Other than that, the amenities and everything else was pretty good. You do notice the age of the property at times, but it does sell itself as a historic venue in Chicago. The lobby itself is quite a beautiful! The ceiling tapestry, the swanky bars, and the excellent decor makes it a place to be on any given night! Definitely a great place for a few drinks with friends to start off the evening. The service was very good and attentive, although I hardly needed anything after my initial check in.

Being a Hilton hotel, I expected so much more from the Palmer House.  I looked at their beautiful rooms on the internet and upon checking in noticed that they received a plaque for being a historic hotel.  Apparently, it being a ""historic"" hotel only meant it was old and creepy. LOBBY: Absolutely beautiful! The walls and ceiling has such amazing and elegant detail.  However, note that the lobby is located on the second floor. ROOMS: My room did NOT look like the rooms on their website and felt quite cold and creepy.  I walked into an outdated room the size of a large closet or tiny bedroom with a double size bed.  Who still has double beds?!   The edge of the bed was extremely close to a door that opened to a tiny closet that had a safe, iron, and ironing board.  My coworkers and I compared the bathrooms to something you might see out of a horror movie like The Shining.  There was also a TUBE tv.  Free internet?  Nope, they charge...and there isn't wireless internet, you need to use an Ethernet cable.

4315,5PUJTqSX,"Rooms are super small and the service is eh... I've stayed at quite a few hotels and this one got me irked enough to jump on Yelp for a review. (1) I called before my flight to put my wife on the reservation since I was coming in 4 hours after her. They assured me this was done even after I asked them how they would do it since they didn't ask for her name. They take the name but I am skeptical. I land in Chicago and sure enough, my wife has been wandering around in 30* weather like a hobo in California clothing. They apologize but that's about it. (2) The guy at the desk was a smart ass. He asks for my ID, I give it to him. He then asks if I go by an alias, I tell him I use my nickname (DJ R***) often (my name is D*** R*** Jr). He finally says, OK, why are you using a different name? I'm a nice guy and will accept it, but most hotels will not. Really? I've been traveling frequently for the better part of 10 years and have never had a problem. (3) I get to the room and damn near hit the bed with the door... THE ROOM IS THAT SMALL. Heel to toe (size 13 show) 4 steps to the door from the bed and 1.5 steps from the wall to the bed on the other side. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Yeh, they put a desk but it's so close to the foot of the bed that it's more intrusive than useful. There is a dresser and TV but it's tucked in a corner rendering the TV unwatchable.

Our check in was great, the staff person was fantastic, offering us great food recommendations and was very friendly.   He offered us the option to upgrade to the executive tower/room.  It was $45 more per night, it included a bigger room, that didn't look straight at another building, a DVD player, WiFi, and the executive lounge that offered free continental breakfast each day, non alcoholic beverages throughout the day and happy hour appetizers and snacks each night.  We went for it and I think it was worth it.  The room was comfortable, the lounge was great to pop into to grab a drink or snack.  It would have been better if a drink or two was also included, but the bar was open from 3-11 each night, so it was nice to have access to that.   The executive floors have their own ""express"" elevators, a business center and some cozy couches/chairs with TV's.

There are many adjectives that I could use to describe the Palmer House but the words elegant and character are at the top of my list. This is an absolutely terrific hotel and if you have never stayed there, at least do yourself the favor of dropping by for a drink or lunch. This hotel has it all and the overall rating of three and a half stars on Yelp is ridiculous. I have travelled the world and if this is not at least a four star hotel then I do not know what is. From time to time unfortunate things happen, but some of the reviewers gave this hotel one star. Really, one star, are you kidding me? This is what one would consider to be a ""grand"" hotel. The second floor lobby is exquisite. The furniture is lavish, the ceiling will invite Sistine Chapel comparisons (ok, I am exaggerating), and the famous Empire Room will make you say ""Wow"" out loud. The hotel is replete with beautiful pictures of the great performers that once performed in the Empire Room. I saw pictures of Jack Benny, Pearl Bailey, and the most beautiful picture of Dorothy Jean Dandridge I have ever seen. Make sure that you take the time to see all of the beautiful black and white pictures. The second floor lobby also has free internet and plenty of tables and chairs if you want to avoid the internet fee, which, by the way, was very reasonable. My room was beautiful and classy. The bathroom was old-fashioned yet bright and the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries added a nice touch. The color combinations used on the curtains and bed linens made the room look elegant and I immediately felt that I received a bargain. The service was amazing. A very classy lady named Tatyana from Bulgaria checked me in. I told her I was excited to be there for my birthday and after a brief chat she upgraded my room. Two days later when I returned for the evening there was a nice bottle of wine with a wonderfully hand-written note thanking me for visiting and wishing me a happy birthday. I thought it was so cool that I saved the cork and the card is part of my screen saver collection. Efficiency accompanied by courtesy is a rare combination in today's world. The courtesy extended by Tatyana was impressive because of its rarity and its genuineness. The hotel is centrally located near the blue and red subway lines obviating the need for you to take a cab from Chicago's O'Hare airport.

No.  I get to the front and the bell man says no valet.... I point the sign that says 24 hour valet in confusion.... man says no... and i think to myself- WTF? ??  so... I end up having to park in some garage across the street and the bell man assured me I could get my parking validated. So fine.   The elevators are SO small.. and old... and seriously I thought I was gonna get stuck in one.  But that is not why I am giving this hotel 1 star.  I am giving this hotel 1 star because I have never experienced such nasty service at any other hotel before. I had to get my parking validated after our time at the spa.  The spa sent me downstairs.  First I got to the concierge.  They can't validate it.  So then I am sent to the front desk... There's a crazy line of people checking in so I thought - well- validation takes 30 seconds so let me just ask someone to validate it.  I go up to someone real quick and ask politely... he responds with a sarcastic rude tone- ""you want validation??? stand in line and you'll get it""   Are you kidding me? I did not respond because I just didn't know what the beep to say to his rude a$$.  How do you seriously talk to a customer like that???  I'm still in disbelief.  Then I stand in line.  After 15 minutes, I finally get to someone and ask him to validate it.  He informs me that since I was not a guest at the hotel, I cannot be validated.  I told him about their valet service not working and he said that its not working today bc the president was at their hotel the day before- what does that have to do with anything?!?! I told them the bell man dude in the front of the hotel said I could be validated, but again I got attitude from this front desk guy.  Then I told them that the spa said the front desk could validate me-- he said go back up to the spa so they can validate me-- but hello they are the ones that sent me downstairs!?  He said he needs proof from the spa... I offered to show him my receipt from the spa but he wasn't having it.  I mean, did I look like a young illiterate teenage punk to these people or something? I'm a freakin 30 yr old physician. WTF. I have NEVER experienced this type of stupidity and crappy service and disrespect of customers from any hotel in chicago before-- not the elysian, not the intercontinental, not affinia, not sofitel, not the W, not the Wit, not the Dana, not the Amalfi, not the Trump, not even the freakin comfort suites!  And also, I kind of was a guest at the hotel--- how bout the fact that I was a guest at the hotel's sorry excuse of a spa and each of my friends got 2 services done and we spent half a freakin day at this crap hotel.  I was fuming but left.  Got to the parking garage and saw that I had to pay 30 some bucks for parking, which would have been around $14 or less if they had their ""24 hour valet service"" working, OR would have been zero dollars if validated.  That's just not the point tho, I have money to spend, but after the responses and attitude I got from these highly untrained workers, it was just really disappointing.   There is SOOOO much more to this story but I have lost the energy to tell any more of it.  All I know is that for a hotel to make themselves out to be so prestigious, they sure do treat their guests like dirt.  I will NEVER be back here.  I would never recommend this backward hotel to anyone ever.

She was actually very nice, and it was kind of funny, but... I was hungry and it's raining outside :P So now I'm at the corner street bakery. Kind of a shame, because there is so much history behind the hotel. Made as a gift for Palmer's wife in September 1871 it burnt down 13 days later in the great Chicago fire. Only to be rebuilt in plush opulent style and setting by 1873. It was the world's first fireproof hotel. It also boatsted telephone and electricity in every room, and something called an 'elevator'. They promoted it by saying it's a train between floors connected by pulley & rope. Palmer took out a $1.7 M loan, at the time to rebuild it, the largest loan for somethig like this. (I think that number is correct). In 1925 it was rebuilt again, this time going from 7 stories to 25 stories. At the time, the largest hotel in the world. In 1943 Conrad Hilton bought it for $20 million. And so, began it slow descent to wired wifi and big booty television sets. The Internet- you have to be plugged in to your room for the wifi to work!!! THAT'S NOT WIFI!!!! Or, you can get ""wifi"" in the hotel lobby, for $8/Hr. $20/night to be plugged in. And the cable is so short you kind of have to sit at the uncomfy desk, no laying in bed surfing the web action. I asked if I can check out an hour later.

If you're looking to walk around at night, this is not the hotel for you.. not too much going on after the shops close around here. Some rooms do come with a refrigerator- if you need it, ask for it.

I was prepared to ignore the fact that the gym costs extra. I usually love any hotel, so for me to take the time to write such a negative review means something is wrong. After I got home on Monday, I realized I had left a dress hanging in the closet in our room. I called right away, and they directed me to the Security/Lost and Found department. I was on hold for 20 minutes, and finally spoke with a woman there. I explained what had happened, gave my room number, described the dress, and provided my contact information. The woman told me that she would have someone check the room right away and call me back later in the day. She never called me back. I called again in the evening, and got a man on the phone. He told me that a couple had checked into the room and that they could not find out if the dress was in there until the next day. I called back on Tuesday, and they told me that the couple had checked out, and they would send someone to look for the dress, and then call me back. No call. Then I called a couple hundred more times, to no avail. On Wednesday, I had to leave the country for a week, so I made a last call from the airport, and was told they would check and call me back. Nothing. My girlfriend then called them for me on Friday and Saturday, without success, because another couple had checked in by that time, and apparently it was impossible to find out whether a dress was hanging in the closet before they arrived. Finally, a full week later, I called and got a man named Michael in the Security Department. He got someone to go to the room and look for my dress, which was (unsurprisingly) gone by that point. Michael apologized and told me that his supervisor was out of the office. I then asked to speak to a Customer Service representative. The hotel operator transferred me to a voicemail. When I called back, she transferred me to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman who informed me that the hotel ""doesn't have a Customer Service department"" and hung up on me. I called back one more time, was again transferred to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman named Nikita who told me that the front desk ""handles customer service."" She then transferred me to her supervisor's voicemail (Ms. Cruz), which stated, ""I am in the office all day but unable to take your call."" Is that even a thing? Every single time I called, I was on hold for 10-20 minutes at least. The total disregard for customer service was both ridiculous and time-consuming.

I gorged myself on the breakfast, snacks, and nighttime hors'doeurves right down the hallway from our extra-large suite. Excellent. Also, bathrooms are much nicer on the Executive Floor, with dual showerheads and ambient lighting. The age of the hotel is really starting to show though, and they haven't gotten around to updating all the rooms, so it's a total crapshoot as to whether or not you get a good one. And after having stayed in both styles of rooms, the older one definitely feels...well, old, almost grandmotherly. Internet is also ridiculously expensive when free WiFi is becoming the standard.

4338,WfgIdtBaDlkh1W,"The Palmer House is a worthy destination if only to spend time in it's magnificent lobby, which resembles more than anything, the most opulent and bizarre of Masonic Lodge interiors. Sadly, the current management of the hotel leans totally on it's great historic beauty; it in fact exploits it. What should by all rights be a ""luxury hotel"" (which one expects when reading about it's historic beauty), fails miserably; the experience can be characterized by mediocre service and a noticeable lack of amenities; it is a wasted treasure, misunderstood and poorly managed by it's current overseers. On a specific note, we were very irritated by the terribly inconvenient internet situation, they had NO wireless and charged $14.95/day for a direct cable connection at a desk in your room - this means you are chained to the desk for all internet activities. This was a real inconvenience. (but do see my photo of my handsome husband, Jon, chained to the desk by a short DSL cable!). Having said all this, the location (in the heart of downtown) is great - very convenient to public transit and taxis, centrally located with easy access to museums and many interesting neighborhoods and with several excellent restaurants nearby. And honestly, the huge, spectacular, historic lobby, in all it's splendor, makes it all worth it. The rooms are clean and acceptably appointed, if not inspired.

4342,EC,"I love old. The history, the people who have gone there before me, the beauty and grandeur of a time gone by, these are all things that draw me to historic places and hotels. The Palmer House Hilton is no exception. Its perfect location close to Millennium Park, nearby shopping, theaters and all that Chicago has to offer makes it a perfect choice when in Chicago. Built in 1871, the Palmer House still exudes the charm and grace of an era gone by. The lobby is breathtaking with it's soaring ceiling painted in 1900 (one of the most photographed ceilings in the world) and the gilded figurines done by Tiffany oh so many years ago. It's quite splendid. As for the rooms, they are okay. They have been upgraded over the years but know given the size of this hotel (over 1600 rooms) that this place gets alot of use so some areas feel a little worn out. On this visit- my room with the soaring ceilings had a large king bed (with some comfy linens) and the bathroom was recently redone. On the down side- there is no coffee maker in the room (it's a Hilton- what Hilton doesn't have free coffee?) they charge a daily fee for Internet use, the TV is bulky and old, there is no mini bar, and because it is an old building, the rooms can greatly vary in size. But here's a trick. If you want those big fluffy towels that I've come to expect from the nicer hotels, tip your housekeeper. The first day I was here- the towels and toiletries were functional but not fancy. Day 2, after I tipped the housekeeper? Sumptuous thick towels and upgraded toiletries. Coincidence? I think not! If you want a drink- try Potter's Bar. And for breakfast, lunch and dinner- Lockwood Restaurant located in the beautiful lobby is open. While there may be a line for weekend breakfast- tell the hostess that you are fine with the communal high top table and you will be seated immediately! Room rates vary so do a bit of negotiating and you should be able to get a competitive rate to other places in the city. And leave the car at home. Valet runs $61 a day (with in and out privileges) or you can park it yourself for about $15 less at one of the nearby parking garages (my favorite is one block south on Adams) It's a piece of Chicago history- still vibrant today. I love the photos of all the famous people who once played in the Empire Room that line the halls of this hotel. I love the opulence and grandeur that are the public spaces. I love afternoon tea in the beautiful lobby. And if I close my eyes, I love that I can almost see the generations that have gone here before me.",4,5,3,0

The most amazing thing was every time I would ride the elevator and people would get off on their floor I would notice that every elevator lobby on each level was different and had it's own design.  Whether it was a piano as the main piece or a circular couch, each lobby had a unique flair.

4354,UT7tzqaxEhQG2Y8fHqisZg,"The only thing I liked about this hotel was the lobby. I went to Chicago for a cousin's wedding and we decided to stay at the palmer house because it is such a historic place. When we first got there we stood in a long line to check in and when I finally got to the receptionist he was not very friendly and freaked out when the reservation was under my moms name and not mine and made my mom come down out of her room to confirm I was telling the truth. Anyway when we got to our room it was rather small. No coffee pot, no fridge, a large old box TV. The room was clean but nothing special. When I was getting ready for the wedding I needed to blow dry my hair and the blow dryer in our room didn't blow hot air so I had to go to my moms room to get a blow dryer. This gets me to my next point: THE ELEVATORS SUCK! Well first off all they put me on the 12th floor and my mom and her husband on the 18th floor. Not necessarily a big deal but the elevators at the palmer house are in three different groups and go to three different groups of floors. What I mean is in the lobby I had to get in the elevators for floors 10-15 and my mom got in elevators for floors 16-20 or something like that. So every time I needed to go to my moms room or vice versa I had to go all the way down to the lobby and then catch the other set of elevators to her floor. HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS! Also because we were there for a wedding, I was supposed to receive a gift bag with snacks and info about the wedding. Well I never got mine and I spent 20 minutes running all over the hotel looking for it with no success. Also at the Palmer house if you need to use a computer or the internet you have to pay a big price. Anyway my mom had to do a reading in the wedding and she lost the piece of paper so I went down to concierge and there were about three of them standing around doing nothing and I asked if they could print this off for me really quick because it was an emergency. They rudely told me to go to the business center and print it off myself. Anyway the service in the lobby SUCKED. However I will say that the cleaning staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Usually when I stay in a hotel just one night I don't need the staff to clean my room so I put the DND sign out. Well we were leaving to go see the sights one morning and the cleaning lady was right there and said oh I was about to clean your room and we said it was fine and then she suggested to give us at least a set of clean towels. VERY NICE CONSIDERATE CLEANING STAFF. Also avoid the restaurant they have in the lobby. The Lockwood I think. Horrible experience. See my next review.

When I got to the hotel they couldn't find my extra day, which was cool because they eventually found it. I was told it would be corrected in the system and put as one reservations rather than two.. Great... that is until I tried to get into my room at like 1am and my key wasn't working! Apparently the woman forgot to fix the error in the system & I was checked out. That was fixed and they checked me back in after about 30 minutes. Next they didn't clean my room the day of the ""check-out situation""... I don't know if it is because no one was supposed to be in the room, but I think that it's disgusting. I was annoyed to enter my room and see my bed still unmade and no new clean towels and wash cloths. Lastly, I was supposed to receive a non-smoking room and received a smoking room.

I mean, if you're going to charge us that much for a room, at least provide us with some internet so we can get work done, check our emails, Yelp...you know? But other than that, I was comfy in my room. Location was great, next to Millennium Park, short walk from the Cultural Center and Art Institute, and a bunch of restaurants nearby. There was also an entrance to the subway line right in front of one of the hotel entrances. I'm not quite sure if I'd stay here again. Depends on the neighborhood and prices and everything.

The staff was increadably nice and helpful. The beds were very comfortable, piled with high quality pillows and down comforters and laid out with soft, high thread count sheets.  They were wonderful and relaxing.  The room was large, pretty and clean.   The price was not bad-- $118 for a king sized room on New Year's Eve weekend, using our AAA discount. Problems: the noise and the bathrooms.  Our room was near the El, so we enjoyed a muted whoosh every 15 minutes or so.  The windows were double paned, so it sounded like a very heavy gust of wind, rather than a Blues Brothers tenament teeth rattling.  The walls were not soundproof, so I know when our neighbors used the loo or when the maid pulled the cart down the hall.  Also the bathrooms were very small.  Very, very small.  And spartan.  Certainly not fitting with the rest of the place.

Quiet despite being right on the main drag AND next to the 'el' train. Staff is professional and helpful. Skip the restaurant for breakfast. And probably skip it for dinner. The Bar and Lounge are the pits. Borrrring alcohol selection. Dullsville. Dog whiz on tap.  A hotel as nice as this serving mass market Scotch is sinful. Pool is a disappointment because 1) it's small, and 2) because the chlorine is so scortchingly strong! I used to have nipples but they got bleached off. Hot tub- Good. I hung out with 8 guys from the American Gay Volleyball Assoc.. They were a little nervous with a straight guy in there, but I told 'em I was from San Francisco and they relaxed right away.

Weddings seem to occur every 15 minutes. Cons: - It's big and tall. I forgot my sunglasses in the room and if fell like a 2k run back to get 'em. - The Hilton chain buffed away some of the charm. The sucky bar, the Charfucks in the basement. Stuff like that. - The period this hotel flourished in feels done and gone. They need a jazz trio playing real jazz in the lounge. Bonus tips.

4368,LnZ6EZBdviLT6Shf5GjQnw,"If you're looking to spend a lot of time in your room, you probably won't like the Palmer House. The rooms are fairly small, though certainly clean and well appointed. I stayed in a single room -- which is to say it had one double bed -- and it probably wasn't much bigger than your bedroom at home. Depends on your home, of course. And it's hard to judge, since in addition to the bed, there was a desk with a chair, a no-longer-in-service minibar, a side table, and an armoire with a TV. More furniture than would fit in my bedroom. But I digress. I've seen single rooms with king sized beds that were larger than this, and the double rooms are quite a bit larger. But if you're staying in downtown Chicago, what are you doing staying in your room? So what if it's small -- it's within walking distance of everything. Get out! Also, the Palmer House has an honest to goodness lobby, where you can sit and relax and have a drink and even eat, depending on the time of day. And it's a huge and beautiful lobby. So if your room is small, but you don't want to leave the hotel, and you aren't completely afraid of other people, hang out in the lobby. The Palmer House was built at a time when people socialized. They enjoyed it, even! Socialize. The registration area is surprisingly tiny, and the hotel is undergoing renovations, so only one entrance is available (on Monroe) and some areas are blocked off. The hotel is a destination spot for proms and business meetings/conventions/seminars, so be prepared for some congestion. And elevators are slow. But these are minor quibbles in a grand old hotel. Don't expect the latest Vegas luxury resort, and you'll be fine. An historical side note: the chef at the Palmer House invented the brownie, more than 100 years ago. The Palmer House still sells their signature brownies. At 10 bucks a pop. I passed.",4,6,2,1

The facilities are gorgeous (and squeaky clean).   I was here one week for a work convention, and the next weekend for the White Sox fest.   My every experience here is magical, no matter what the occasion is!

4371,ZAzL4jY43JDp0LhreidTrw,"Hotwire landed me here for $75/night.  Since I wanted a Loop hotel that wasn't a hooker hotel but still within my ""work is NOT paying for this"" budget.  So I was not unpleased that I'd be staying here.  My grandparents' best friends had honeymooned here, so it had some third-hand nostalgia going for it.  Throw in a fab location, and I was thrilled when I walked in. If the hotel were a person, it'd be old-money.  (Like the cranky great-aunt you hope to inherit from.)  But like old-money, there's some rust around the edges.  The lobby is amazingly gorgeous.  No hands down.  The guest rooms... kinda small and shabby, for a Hilton.  The closet and bathroom were tiny.  There was only about a foot of clearance betwixt door and dunny in the loo, and that doesn't really work.  There was only about 6"" of vanity space on either side of the sink.  I'm sure this was standard when the place was built, and it's modern standards that have changed.  But still.  It's a bit cramped, and it was just me in the room. Realistically, it's an older building, and a skyscraper at that, which is going to entail lots of structural support to work around.  Revamping the guest rooms would probably entail knocking down walls and re-doing entire floors, which would be disruptive to other guests, a loss of revenue, and there'd be fewer rooms available in the end.  (I think.  I'm a CPA, not an architect, but to my amateur eyes, it does not look like it'd be an easy remodel.)  Sorry.  HGTV moment.  Where was I?   Also like old money, this place can be cheap in irritating ways.  $15 (or more) for internet in your room, and wired at that, so no surfing while sitting in bed.  $7 for an hour for internet in the lobby.  WTF?  On the one hand, if I lived in Chicago, and the lobby had free internet, I'd be inclined to take up space there quite often.  On the other hand, $7 for an hour of internet in the lobby??   I've never been somewhere where internet in the lobby came at a price.   (There was too much stone for my T-Mobile smart phone to get any signal.  Which meant I missed a couple calls.  Grr.) Thanks to Yelp I was forewarned about early check-in fees and late check-out fees.  I was honestly surprised that storing my luggage didn't come with a fee.   I didn't interact much with the staff, but they seemed very professional, especially at the front desk.  (I'd put my hotel room keycard behind the magnet closure in my purse, so I had to get it re-programmed at 1:00am.  They asked for ID, which is reassuring, for safety reasons.) I'm glad I came here, at least once.  The public areas are beautiful, and I like pretty architecture.  I probably wouldn't seek it out again as a place to stay, though.  I would, however, definitely be willing to meet people in the lobby for cocktails.  As long as we didn't expect to use our cell phones to find each other.",3,3,3,5

4374,gvhexqhA38nvR8TXSvQd1w,"Having worked at the Ritz Carlton during my younger days, I'm somewhat of a hotel snob. When you're used to providing exemplary service, you kind of expect it when you stay in a hotel right? I don't mean to be a snob but this is one industry where customer service is everything. You're leaving your home to sleep and eat somewhere else. You should feel like you're staying in a second home. My family and I took a family vacation to Chicago to bury my Grandma's ashes and do some sightseeing while we were there. My Mom booked this hotel from Priceline so I was skerred all the way there. I'd never seen the PH so I was skeptical at best. They were doing some work on the front of the hotel and it was a mess but they were very careful not to inconvenience the guests which was much appreciated. Nothing is worse than fearing for your life by entering a door. (It came out beautiful by the way). When we arrived, we were given a key to my Mom & sisters room and another key to mine and my brother's room. My room was SO small and on a different floor than my Mom's room so I asked if they could move us. Good thing! We got a room that was twice as big and had a better view. You could have put another 4 beds in that room and it wasn't considered a suite. Sweet for us! The lobby is amazing and gives you that feeling of old-world Chicago. It was like getting in a time machine but not in a bad way. Everything was well maintained and all the employees made us feel like they were honored we were there. We even got a nice note from the front desk worker a few hours after we checked in. The hotel bar is a little pricey and stuffy so we opted for the dive bar next door with all the pictures on the wall. Help me out with the name here people, I loved that place. It was literally next door from the entrance that faces the El. I was worried about the location of this place but we managed to walk everywhere we needed to go. It was really nice having Corner Bakery on the corner too, they have great breakfasts. Didn't try the breakfast in the hotel because we were usually in a hurry to go on an adventure. I guess the only reason why I can't give them 5*s is because I'm still and always be a hotel snob. You're going to have to ramp it up to mimic the Four Seasons or Ritz for me to max it out.

When I was explaining my choice to some colleagues I told them that it used to be very elegant, but now was a little worn and frayed around the edges and the plumbing was a little iffy.  One of the younger members of the group said ""That sounds just like you, Dr. Rick"" to which someone added ""When the hell was Rick ever elegant?"". The service was perfect and the room, albeit small compared to newer hotels, was very comfortable and quiet.  I have a 3G wireless widget  for my computer, so I didn't have to pay for their expensive Internet connection.  A coffee pot would have been nice in the room, but there's a Starbucks on the street level.  All in all, my stay was pleasant and since it's so close to the museums and other downtown attractions I'd stay there again if I had more time to enjoy the city.",3,4,3,3

I agree that the rooms are small - but really, how much room do you actually need to sleep? - There is so much going on right outside the hotel that I find it hard to see why people would want to spend the entirety of their stay indoors. And if they did, the beds in the newly renovated rooms are plush and the shades completely darken the place.   One thing that bugged me was the lack of cell phone reception throughout much of the hotel.  I could hardly get a signal - which either says something about Sprint or something about the bunker-like construction methods used in the 1800s.   Regardless, the rates we paid (via Priceline) were super cheap, about $80 before taxes and fees.  So, I can deal with a small room and having to call for more towels or pillows.  One thing that bugged me was the parking, it was super expensive (about $30 - and that was the special deal).  Anyway, you don't really need a car here because you are steps from the El and a lot of other points of interest are right outside your door.

I'm writing this review from my hotel room, and am paying $14.95 a day for the internet connection. I guess that's not so unusual, and at least there are three differently priced connection options based on speed (I went for the cheapest). But I just feel nickel-and-dimed! It really started with the $25 extra fee for early check-in (about noon). I've never heard of that before. Kind of ticked me off right when I got here. I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge room. But was very surprised to find a teeny tiny bathroom, especially given the size of the room. The bathroom is so small, that even though I am the only person in my huge hotel room, I can barely get into the bathroom and have to squeeze around the door, then shut the door to have room to stand at the sink, or anything else. But first I have to get the light to turn on, so it is not pitch black when I close the bathroom door. This is a major production since it is kind of stuck in the ""off"" position. To add insult to injury, although there is a magnifying mirror attached to the wall (the kind you can use to put on makeup extra-carefully), it's attached at a height designed for someone about 6 feet tall! Since I'm 4'11"", I can't actually see myself in the mirror. It just taunts me by being there. On to the actual room. Clean. Comfortable. Wait, why am I only giving this hotel 2 stars? Well, there is no coffee maker! I can't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel where there wasn't a small coffee set in the room. I guess they want me to buy the starbucks in the lobby instead. But I was kind of counting on the coffee set to heat hot water, so I could make my Trader Joe's instant oatmeal packet in the morning for breakfast. Hmmm. I guess they'd rather I bought the hotel oatmeal for $5 a bowl. And I also guess I could ask for a coffee set to be brought to my room. Would only cost $8. *sigh* Well, at least I brought workout clothes for the 4 days I'm staying here. At $18 per day (or $45 per 3 days), it's a bit pricey just to be able to work out for a few days, but at least I'll be able to use the spa amenities too, right?. Well, luckily I checked out the fitness center before paying, because I just don't like it. Most folks would probably like it fine, but the elliptical machines (only thing I use) here are *again* made for someone 6 feet tall, not someone my size. And the spa amenities aren't all that appealing. And since there are no 24 hr fitness locations nearby (I'm a member), I guess I brought my workout clothes for no good reason other than to use up the space in my luggage. Okay, this review is getting kind of long, and a bit too whiney. So for my last issue with this hotel - I tried calling the ""guest service hotline"" several different times since I've been here to ask some questions, but I don't think they actually staff the ""hotline"". On four different attempts, I only once reached an actual person, and I let it ring about 20 times each attempt before giving up. Last night all I wanted to know was where I could get some ice. When they finally directed me to the room with an icemaker (near the elevator), it was a room with peeling paint, cracks on the wall, and a flickering lightbulb. Yech. Tonight I wanted to ask some questions about getting back to the airport. I guess I'll just have to figure it out myself.",2,9,2,2

When you walked into the room, instantly, I knew why the room was so inexpensive.  They gave us a queen size bed after informing us that they were all out of king sizes (we had a late check-in).  The bed seemed to take up the entire room.  When I looked out  the window, my ""view"" consisted of brick walls and the windows of other rooms.  I now realized why other rooms had their curtains drawn. The bathroom was fairly large, however, we couldn't get the stopper to stay up and keep the bathtub from filling with water, not to mention the fact that the the bathroom had no ventilation of any kind, which makes for a pretty stinky deal, if you catch my drift (pun intended). All in all, the room served its purpose: Sleeping, showering and changing for a very short stint in Chicago.  If I were on ""vacation"", I would have definitely opted to upgrade to a suite for a more comfortable stay.   The pros of the hotel: Nice bar, lobby/lounge area, Starbucks is conveniently located downstars.  It was conveniently central to everything: Millennium Park, Grant Park, a few blocks walking distance from Magnificent Mile. However, the best part about this hotel: It had a UPS connected to one of its South entrances, which was open on Sunday!  I ended up getting stamps and sending postcards to family, as well as mailed a t-shirt I had purchased for my niece.  That UPS was the saving grace of my trip.  Had it not been open, I'm sure the t-shirt would still be sitting in the corner of my room, a miserable heap, begging to be shipped to a pretty princess in San Diego.",3,0,0,0

Luckily it survived unscathed, but it wasn't the best beginning to the trip.  The lobby at the Palmer is always packed like the MGM Grand or something, and with all of the hotels in downtown Chicago I can't really figure out what the draw is.  There was no line at the check in desk despite the crowd, so we were able to get up to our room really quick.  Then we opened the door. Now when you book a room on Hotwire technically you aren't supposed to get many options, but we did book for two adults... and it's a big assumption on the part of the hotel that these two adults are married or a couple as only one person's name gets entered in.  So we were a bit shocked to see that inside our very tiny room was a single double bed.  I mean this the U S of A people... double beds should be legislated out of existence by now.  My wife calls down to the front desk asking to switch to a different room and is told we can't be moved until Sunday.  Then I call and we can magically get moved that very night.  Definitely happy about the move, not sure why the voice of a male was needed to make it happen. The rest of the experience continued to be pretty lackluster.  Every single morning we were there at around 8:30am the cleaning staff would gather outside the door to our room and from the sounds of it were conducting their staff meeting. Well, I'm not being serious about the meeting part, but they were seriously LOUD.  Want to sleep in at the Palmer?  You can forget about it. Also be prepared for all sorts of typical downtown Chicago hotel nickel and diming.  We didn't want to pay for the internet, so we decided we'd go down to hang out at the Starbucks inside the Palmer because all Starbucks have free wifi now.  Not this one.  Palmer shuts it down. Eh, I could say more but you probably get the point.",2,5,0,2
4383,JKknzjO2zv3wa,"I Pricelined a hotel in the loop and ended up with the Palmer House for a last minute trip to Chicago on June 2 - June 6. Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location!  Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm.  Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room. Lots of dropped calls. All in all we had a great experience at the Palmer House. I would definitely recommend it if you are able to get a good price on Priceline.",4,3,1,0

My room is huge - but I heard some of my coworkers complaining about small rooms.  Maybe I just lucked out.  It also has great decor, and the beds are oh so comfortable.  The mirror in the bathroom is lit from the back - so it's excellent for getting ready.

The halls to the rooms are a bit confusing as we got lost on our first go round, but all the maids in the hallways working were super friendly and directed us correctly. The room was really cute and very spacious. We had a double bed room and it also came with desk, a large comfy chair and ottoman. TV was old school CRT but no big deal. I peeked into other rooms as we would walk around the halls and some were not nearly as large and others appeared to have rooms within rooms. Bathroom was pretty standard and the tub made me feel claustrophobic without a curved shower rod. The bed was comfortable and I really liked all the decor of the hotel inside rooms and inside the halls. We had an issue with the shower and the maintenance guy came right away and we also got extra towels very quickly after requested. Concierge was super helpful and friendly and booked us our tour bus tickets online to save us 10%. Also, great people watching in the bar area. Careful though, I got caught checking someone out. http://Embarassed.com I enjoyed my brief stay here and found the location to be very convenient.",4,2,3,3
4387,odVRab,"We were sixteen and both in town for a youth conference. We were pretending to be delegates from the United Nations and we had a mock General Assembly with all the ad hoc committees and panels to boot. I was representing the US in the OAS (Organization of American States), and she was Argentina. We shared glances across the room, and as she spoke from the dais, I drooled. Now, I was an early bloomer they would say, and it was proven by my winning the coveted Congeniality Award upon our return from solving the world's problems (later this award would be renamed ""The Corey Hart Award""). Wink wink. Argentina and I had a quick love affair, skipping out of our small conference room to co-author resolutions on Cuba-US treaties and make out. It was in a cold Palmer House stairwell that I made it to second base, and it was in the not so private double room where we sealed the deal. Well, we almost sealed the deal. We were sadly interrupted by the pounding on the big and heavy Palmer House hotel room doors by the chaperone of my group. He was tipped off to the evil goings on inside the room by my roomie sulking outside in the hall. That rat! Well, needless to say, I've had a long long love for this hotel. It's been recently renovated, and through its renovation, never shut down! This they've done before, making it the longest continuously operating hotel in America. The hotel reclaims its older charms with this latest renovation, and the room upgrades were a welcome touch. A walk down the halls and you can see pictures of what the hotel looked like in the past, as well as catch glimpses of what kind of wild parties were going on back in the day. In the ballrooms, in the bars, and in the large large suites. The staff, service, and accompaniments are like any you'd find in a top notch Hilton property, and the location is great. Love blues? Then stay nowhere else, for here you're blocks away from Buddy Guy's Legends, a must visit. You're also close to the Chicago Theater, the landmark Marshall Field's (I refuse to refer to it as Macy's), and head toward the lake for access to parks, museums, and the South Loop's only Panda Express. Visiting in winter for Christmas? Walk West to find the christkindlmarket on Washington between Clark and Dearborn. There you'll find large, bright trees, a beer garden, and dozens of stalls peddling all sorts of Austrian, German, and Bavarian goods, gifts, and foods. I bring everyone I show around Chicago to the Palmer House, and it never disappoints. There's always oooohing, ahhhing, and wows. The majesty of the reception/foyer/seating/lobby area is well... simply timeless and breathless. This is an American icon without a doubt. Tip: steal your girl/guy away into a stairwell for me. And tip the concierge already!",4,5,1,5

As I type this review, I am sitting in my room at the Palmer House Hilton.  I am in Chicago on business, and found this hotel after checking hhonors because the W (the preferred hotel in Chicago) was sold out.   Overall, the room is very nice, albeit very small (on the 13th floor).  The lobby is huge, and reminds me a lot of the Westin St. Francis or the Sir Francis Drake back in SF.  It has that ""blue hair appeal"" that makes a 28 year old feel a bit out of place.  If you're into flirting with GILF's or something, this place is a goldmine.  The hotel staff are polite and helpful.  The bathroom is the size of an iphone, at least the one in my room is.  If you stay here, ask for the state/adams side rather than the monroe/wabash side so you don't have to listen to the L trains every few mins.  This side is much quieter. I'd stay here again (especially with the double points hhonors promo), but this definitely isn't my favorite hotel on earth.  Its a clean, nice, and moderately opulent hotel suitable for its 250/night price.",4,2,0,1

The cons-You hear everything that happens on your floor, from someone flushing the toilet to entering their room.  This is one of the loudest hotels I have stayed at.   And when you pay around 300 a night, it would be nice to actually get a few hours of sleep.",2,0,1,0

4397,qA5zPPxPBUPZWeBryfMHPA,"Since it was New Year's Eve, I will need to start out this review by saying that I didn't really pay attention to specific details of my experience at the hotel. I do know a few things though. Enter the Palmer House Hilton: location is decent. If I were a guest staying downtown and wanted to experience the city, I probably wouldn't choose this location unless you want to be closer to Millenium Park. Walking into the hotel, it's gorgeous. It's massive size reminds me of hotels in Vegas that go on for miles. In fact, I believe that the lobby with all of the bars, etc. also reminds me of a Vegas hotel (without the casino of course). I wanted to get there early to have a cocktail prior to leaving for my party, but ended up falling behind. Never EVER wait until after 5 to check into the hotel on NYE. The line was nuts. Lucky guests waited in line while others in their party got them drinks from the bar. I knew I should have brought another person with me. Oh well. On the website, I was notified if you are staying on the Executive Level, there is a quick credit card check-in option to avoid long lines. This was not the case when I got there and the lady at the front desk never heard of that. Interesting. Perhaps something for them to look into during crowded periods? Though, for my long wait, the front desk lady gave me late check out at 2pm for free. I chose executive level because 1) it sounded cool 2) I figured it would be quieter with more business people (or just less children). Little did I know it also comes with breakfast and appetizers from 5-7 on a special floor. Fun stuff. The room was NICE. It was large and came with a couch, tv, desk, nice bed, and decent bathroom. The bed was comfy. Or it felt that way after my NYE partying. And it's not squeaky and has plenty of pillows. I just hope they wash their sheets. Vending machines. All I wanted in the morning was a bottled water, but did not have enough 1s. So I thought since it was $2.50, I could buy two and use a $5. Well, I found out it only takes 1s. Not cool. I don't like to use the glasses in the rooms due to shows about how they are never washed. I was forced to use one. :( I didn't end up using my late checkout since I got about 3 hours of sleep (it was New Years!) . I checked out on my phone to avoid lines and grabbed some ""breakfast"" in the lounge upstairs right before it closed. It was pretty much picked through, but I got a sesame bagel and chive and onion cream cheese. Definitely needed something in my stomach. All in all, I really enjoyed staying on the Executive Level. I did feel cool. We had separate elevators where you have to insert your key to get in. And the elevator was right by the front desk. I'm not sure where the other elevators were located, but that was pretty convenient. The hotel definitely served its purpose and I would stay here again if I'm in the area.",4,1,1,1
4398,vp0eumnnkQec8aXLR2wkCA,"I spent a few years working in hotels before moving becoming a meeting planner so I feel like I can give a fair judgment of a hotel and I am just not sure I would return to the Palmer House. I understand it's a historic hotel, however I was in room 21-167 and beside the room being the smallest hotel room I've ever been in I don't think it was maintained very well. The carpet is worn and and needs replacing (felt the same about the hall and elevator landing) There was black hair on the shower walls, mildew on the shower grout, trash BEHIND the trash can in the bathroom, and it looked like the bath amenities had been used and not replaced. The woman who checked me was was in training according to the badge she was wearing but it took her forever to check me in, she didn't say more than 2 words to me so it was mostly awkward silence. The remote in my room didn't work and when engineering came up with a 2nd one that didn't work. I was told that they were in the middle of a shift change so someone else would have to come up and it took almost 30 mins, that guy brought a remote & did something to the TV before telling me it was fixed (I was working at the desk). However, when I went to turn the TV off the 3rd remote wasn't working either. Because I arrived at 1:30pm, left at 4pm, returned at midnight and went straight to bed, got up at 6 am and left at 6:30 for a flight I didn't say anything to the hotel, it just wasn't worth the hassle of moving. However, if I had been there any longer I would have complained to the front desk. No wireless Internet in the guest rooms. They get 3 stars because: Convenient location, the doorman who got me the cab to get to the airport was very friendly, and the 3rd star out of hope that I just had an off experience.

4399,8W51WfdSQ--C8jp-yWwGOw,"I'm going to give Palmer House three stars, due to the fact that our stay there was just over a year ago, and a few things have changed since then (which I just learned of when booking another room for next month).   If you will note the photos that we just uploaded, Palmer House doesn't look like that anymore, nor does the Lockwood Restaurant and Bar look like that anymore.   As they have completely remodeled.   And another thing of note is that Chicago imposed an indoor smoking ban just about a year ago.     While the hotel was most certainly grand, like 3 star (on a scale of 1-3), luxury abounding, I'm not staggeringly impressed by that sort of stuff anymore as I have seen enough of it.    But it's nice if you are with your wife.     We arrived at 11pm and while I had reserved a NON-SMOKING room, apparently they were having a large convention and I suspect they gave away my room.    I had a room number and they gave me a new one.   And what was it?   A smoking room.   I was told that was the last room left (which was likely not true) or they just bumped me as we arrived late in the evening.     I was like ""Oh fuck me...""     And since we didn't feel like trying to find somewhere else to stay, having just valet parked our rental car, we decided to just stay.   Upon entering the room it did in fact smell like a pink sheet trader had been chain smoking stogies.   Revolting.   And I say that as a man that enjoys a cigar after drinks.    It was just stagnant.    Horrible I tell you.   I complained when I checked out, complained on the phone when getting back home a few days later, and Hilton never offered to make amends for this in any way.    And to be honest I don't remember if I called my credit card company or not, I don't think I did, but they probably would have covered me, as this was not what I ordered.   Regardless of this initial bad experience, due to the history and location, we will be staying there again.   But this time I told them that if you stick us in a smoking room again, I ain't paying for it!",3,2,1,1

Are there this many people checking in right now? Actually, their computers were down, so check ins were being done...I actually have no idea how they were doing them, but it took a while.  As we stand in line, hotel staff are walking around handing out glasses of sparkling wine.  Okay, I can live with this.....two glasses later, we are checking in.  When the man at the front desk sees my reservation, he mysteriously disappears to the back for what seemed to be 20 minutes.  Upon his return he says he upgraded our room to a queen bed.....from a twin??? WTF! Why would you have a twin bed in a hotel? At least that's what both my boyfriend and I heard, but we were too stunned to ask more questions.  We were also given a cute little gift bag that we later realized was not from the hotel, but from the wedding party   So our grand upgrade was a small room with not much of a view and a tiny, but beautiful bathroom.  Since we were not planning on spending much time in the hotel, this was perfect.  We needed a place to sleep and get dressed.  We were walking everywhere, so we didn't need the gym and we were not driving, so valet and parking wasn't a concern. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Millennium and Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier, Wendella Boat Tours, and a ton of shopping and food options.  The wedding events were less than two miles away, so it was a pleasant walk when we wanted to or a short and inexpensive cab ride when we didn't want to walk.   We had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, Lockwood, one morning.  The food was good, but it was way overpriced.  Although, I'm a sucker for lox and bagel fixings every time, so I was happy.  Overall we had a great experience.  The convenience of everything close by, made our stay here worthwhile.",4,1,0,1

I'd rate this 3.5, but will give it 4 instead of 3 because it's so pretty inside. I'm easily swooned by this type of decor. We stayed here for the sole purpose of sleeping - I didn't even get a chance to see the pool or anything else. We road tripped from Houston to Chicago to Niagara Falls all within a week! Our room on the 21st floor wasn't small, we were in a corner room so one view was skyscrapers, the other Millennium Park. No complaints regarding room size/view! I didn't realize we were right next to the train tracks, but the sounds didn't really bother us. We got settled in around 9 PM on a weekday, didn't know where to dine or what was open, so we just wandered and hoped to find something. Sadly, most restaurants were closed or closing by then and the few places I had wanted to eat (via Yelp reviews) were too far. I'm definitely researching more in advance next time! The bellhops were all really nice - taking bags to the room once we were settled in, storing our luggage, etc. I saw the receptionist offer everyone else in line bottled water - but didn't offer us any! Concierge was not helpful when we were trying to find information about Chicago Trolley tours. She just said ""wait at CVS and you'll see someone there."" No one was there! Luckily, the Palmer House is one of their stops and we were able to get on when it stopped at the light. The Corner Bakery Cafe is right next to the hotel, so we ate there for breakfast before going on our tour! I don't think I'll be paying $4 for a banana at the hotel restaurant anytime soon..

I had every intention to workout at the fitness center until I saw that you had to pay a nominal fee to get in the there. We decided to try out the hotel.  And I had an expedia ticket of $10 off a night.  We weren't impressed enough to return. Convenient phone/tv checkout to avoid the front desk.

There is a starbucks and convenience store inside, very nice bar, convention center, and impeccable rooms.   It's also one block down from DePaul University. My room had two double beds with a ""lounge"" space with two chairs and one ottoman. My only complaint about the room was the slightly crammed bathroom. I could have used an extra foot or two.

Walk to clients, restaurants, theaters, museums, etc. Old school decor and charm with a beautiful lobby. Many rooms are reasonably large (though if you scrounge for the cheapest rate it's on one of the tiny ones). Good prices at times. Stayed 3 nights around New Year's Eve for about 300 all-in. THE BAD: ""Old school decor"" also means poor room lighting and tiny bathrooms. Deteriorating service for Hilton HHonors members. Staff takes an attitude of, ""We've provided the minimum guaranteed benefits, and that's all you're going to get."" It's a shame because they used to go the extra mile.  Prices are often high (200+/night) at which point there are usually better values elsewhere downtown.",3,1,0,0

I was absolutely taken away with the grandeur of the hotel lobby.  The Palmer House Hilton is a beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. It's in a fantastic location -- there are lots of great restaurants in the area; it's within walking distance to many of the city's top must-sees; and there's very easy access to the subway (the Red Line is right outside of the hotel). I arrived in the morning around 10am, which is way early for check-in.  I was planning to store my bags until the afternoon when the rooms would be ready. However, the woman at the front desk was able to find one room ready at that time (the other wasn't ready yet), which was fine by me! How wonderful! It was nice to freshen up and change before heading out to explore the city. The room was ginormous! My friend had told me the last she stayed there her room was tiny were small, so needless to say, I was thrilled when I walked in.  There was enough space to waltz if you wanted to!  Good bath products, excellent water pressure (that is so important to me).  The beds were super comfy.  For someone who doesn't normally sleep well to begin with - much less in a hotel - my head sank into the pillows and I fell asleep right away each night. Just a couple of negatives: cell phone service was very spotty in the hotel. In fact, I had no service at all when I was in the lobby.  F&B service in the lobby wasn't great.  We sat in one of the comfy chairs along the wall, hoping to have one last drink before we flew out that evening.  There was a menu on our table so clearly they do service all the tables.

The event space (Empire Room) did not seem to be outdated/falling apart at all, and the room was very charming. The lighting was soft and the gold/black ornamentation was beautiful. If you have severe allergies, I'm not sure this is a place that will listen 100%, and this is an important caveat. One of my good friends is severely allergic to dairy. She called weeks in advance and was assured that there were no problems with her request. But what happened? She had a severe allergic reaction and had to be carried out by paramedics, spending time in the hospital. The hotel could've done a better job not only apologizing, but also honoring her request. Another small error was made in that a few random people wandered into the Empire Room. This isn't a huge deal, but from a security standpoint, it should be treated as one. A Keith Urban lookalike, who was obviously not a guest at a sorority formal (I can understand older dates, but he looked at least 35...), entered the room when I was outside with my friend.

King sized bed, crib was in room as requested, no feather pillows as requested, got to use the short check-in line as an Honors member...room was clean and the daily maid did a wonderful job upholding that standard!!

Dennis was always at the door, helping to  get us cabs and assistance getting our bags upstairs. I think his title should be  Chicago Ambassador, as he recommended the absolute best beach for us to go to with a young child and seemed to be able to make conversation with pretty much anyone.  Good asset to the hotel.

The place is beautiful, that is for sure; a throwback to a time when fine hotels were majestic and grand and not modern and boutique: fresco ceilings in the lobby, gold trim, open bar and huge lobby.   The problem is twofold: it is aging and it is expensive for what you get.  The rooms have a old feel to them, but they are still quite old and small.  You don't get much room for your money and with so many great luxury hotels downtown, it is tough to make this the go-to choice.   Plus, the ample conference facilities means that the lobby is all jammed up with people from whomever the hotel is hosting that day. If you are going to stay in Chicago and want to blow ~$200/night on a hotel, I would stay elsewhere.",2,0,0,0

It has been restored to one of the finest properties in the entire world. The outside remains the same, but when you get into the lobby it is fantastic. Especially when decorated for Christmas. We are using the family picture shot in front of the tree for our card this year, and it was almost non-stop picture taking from everyone who walked by the tree. After we checked in (more on that in a minute) we had to go have a drink in the lobby. The bar is cozy and is in/out of the restaurant, and there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit in the lobby itself. It was awesome just to take in the view and enjoy a drink....we almost stayed for another but had to head out for dinner. With the location of the property (State Street in the theatre district/a block from Millennium Park) this is a MUST STAY while in Chicago. As for the room, the general manager Dean Lane really took care of my family. He put us in the best room I have ever stayed in (The Daley Suite) right on the parade route/State Street, and had a bottle of wine and cookies and milk for the kids in the room.

Very classy and decadent in it's interior decor, it's a mix of the old with the new. Any personality can take light of the intimacy and nostalgia the lobby brings. A competent bar and restaurant awaits you on both sides of the main lobby, with reception very close by, and an excellent concierge service. Room service will take a toll on your wallet, but at a place like this - you shouldn't be at all surprised. The room rates and size vary according to how much you can pay, so expect to show some franklins if you wish to accommodate a large number of individuals to stay. This definitely isn't a motel six where you can cram a family of five for 80 bucks. My only gripe with the hotel is how the rooms are laid out. It can be a bit of a hassle to reach your final destination - your room. You'd think it was enough to fly, go through security checks, possibly experience the dreaded and inconsistent el from either O'Hare or Midway... but no. It doesn't end when you pick up your room keys. Let's just say I wouldn't want to have a serial killer after me. I'd totally get lost.

4452,HlR4dKOBP9VxQWH4RHRF8Q,"At first  glance, the Palmer exudes luxury. It has a gorgeous lobby (as is depicted in the photos on the website and the reviews here), and an art deco charm when you first walk in. It is clearly a hub of events from weddings to meetings with the corporate meeting rooms and the 1000+ rooms to accommodate everyone. However, in the realm of hotels I have experienced as a pleasure and business traveler, I have to admit Palmer House gets an ""eh"" when it comes to the room. My room was a double (to be shared with my sister and mom) while we were attending my cousin's wedding this past weekend. The room itself was spacious and had 2 full (but super super small with no ventilation) bathrooms which were awesome and a blessing in disguise when you have 3 women getting ready in the mornings. But that's pretty much it. The TV was super old school, and sits on one of those old hutches  that are awkward to get around and was about 24 inches max. No coffee maker or mini fridge, thereby forcing you to go to their restaurant  for coffee or waters (although there is an in house Starbucks on the lowest level which is only open until about 8 I think). The restaurant and bar also close super early so we were forced to look elsewhere at 12 am on a Saturday night for late night food and drinks. It is not a hotel I would return to to relax in tranquility as I could hear my neighbors above and next door talk loudly at ALL hours. I give it 1 star for the area in which is sits--super close to State street which has shopping which came in handy on a sweltering 90 degree day, as well as being close to Millennium Park and some good food. A couple of train lines and taxis abound. 3 stars for the AMAZING security team who helped my mom get around by bringing the wheelchair in a timely fashion multiple times a day when requested. Seriously, I don't know how I would have done it without them! Its a big hotel and really hard to get around if you are disabled and need help. Minus 1 star for the quality of the room overall and the lack of some amenities I would expect from a metropolitan hotel. I think if you are looking for a place to crash in while enjoying everything the city of Chicago has to offer, the Palmer will suffice.

The staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are more than willing to get a little creative if need be. Unfortunately the luxury aesthetics of the hotel are reflected by its price tag, the rooms start at $200 a night and go up, the food in the restaurant is top-notch but also top-tier, same for the bar and other amenities such as $18/stay internet. Unfortunately there is also no wireless within the rooms and cell phone signal is non-existant within most of the building, both of these are probably factored in by the fact that the building has quite a bit of marble in the interior which will block both of these signals. Staying in downtown chicago I thought there would be a good variety of selection for food, however outside of a pizza place one block away, and a hot dog place 5 blocks away everything consisted of the same recurrent chains every block - you will see at least one of these every 2 blocks: subway, mcdonalds, 7/11, cvs, starbucks - outside of that and the two independently run places i mentioned earlier the closest thing is a trip to the greek section which is about 2 miles away.",3,0,0,0

The ambiance is one of elegance and the presentation was amazing. I was very excited to complete the check-in process and make my way to my room. I knew that there was something strange upon check in - the representative said something about me being in a suite and how that was too large for one person. He then proceeded to downgrade my reservation to a standard room despite my assertion that I did not want to make that change. Dismayed with the check in process I made my way to my room which only increased my frustration with the hotel. The room was small, very small. Although the hotel had recently been renovated, the impression I got was that not much thought had been put into the design/layout of these rooms. The bathroom was terribly small. The toilet was the centerpiece of the room and from there you could adjust the water in the shower or do your hair in the mirror. Okay, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration but not much. The only redeeming quality about this room was that the bed was comfortable and clean. Of note - the hotel did not offer wireless internet, the elevators were very slow, and none of the staff seemed overly friendly or engaged. Furthermore, while dining at their main restaurant, I had to wait nearly an hour to get a check after our server went missing. In summary, this will be my first and my last stay at the hotel.

It was very small, the beds were full size, which is something I had never seen in a [Hilton] hotel before. The bathroom has the be the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in my entire life. One person couldn't really be in there comfortably, forget about having two! Motel 6 has bigger bathrooms than this. The lighting is super poor and the view was terrible. What really turned me off was the staff at the hotel did not allow alcohol in the rooms. They made up some BS about licensing agreements and other legal mumbo jumbo, but really it was just an excuse for them to get more money out of people, because they said if they found alcohol in a room they were going to charge a ""cork fee"" of $60 per bottle. So, you're meaning to tell me that after already paying for a night in your hotel, plus paying to go to the party, you're going to charge me for having liquor that I PAID FOR MYSELF???

4508,k1WmMKffLi167QNPUc-fuA,"I was SO excited to spend a night at the fabled Palmer House this past spring!  My place of business had rented a room there so some of us could get changed after preparing for an event on Michigan Avenue, and I decided to crash there overnight before heading home the next morning.  The room was small. Very small.  But, okay, the Palmer House has been there since, when?  the late 1800's?  So I'll excuse the size of the room.  Decorating? Gauche. And NO FAN in the BATHROOM!  Imagine three women trying to shower, change, do hair in a postage stamp room when there's no fan in the bathroom.  All of the mirrors were fogged over.  NOT good.   After the event, I was ready for a great night's sleep. It was around 12:30 when I crawled into bed. At 1:45, someone started banging on the door across the hall, and yelling for ""LaShonda"" to wake up.  this went on for about three minutes, and, just as I was about to call security, LaShonda got out of bed, opened the door, explained that she was drunk and had puked all over the place, and let the door banger in.  I fell asleep again at about 2:30.  At 4AM, the guy in the room next to me decided it was time to call Mike and see if they could ""get some women.""  Bill, the other guy in Mike's friend's room, kept saying, ""It's 4 o'clock in the morning."" But Mike's friend, apparently had a deep need for a woman.  I didn't know whether to call the front desk or yell through the wall the suggestion that Mike's friend and Bill go across the hall and get LaShonda.  After about ten minutes, I heard the door bang and Bill and Mike's friend headed out onto the mean streets of Chicago to look for women.  Then, at about 7, the families started trundling down the hall with their wheeled suitcases and squeaky-voiced children.  This eventful night at the Palmer House set my company back $321.  Maybe they have extremely nice suites available for more than that, with sound proofing that really keeps you from hearing about LaShonda's puking or Mike's friend's need for women, but I would not go back. Ever.  We complained to the management, and they were unmoved.  So, in this case, you get 'way less than you pay for. Does not live up to hype or its storied history.",2,1,0,1

4512,1BD,"There's no Chicago luxe like late 19th century Chicago luxe. Because of it's uniqueness, beauty, and proximity to the Shedd Aquarium, we selected the Palmer House for our wedding weekend room block. I had been to the Palmer House for fabulous and fun events before, but never before stayed there. The special events staff is very easy to work with and quick to reply to emails. It seemed like our event kept changing hands, but that everyone seemed to know what was going on. We kept adding guests after our rate had supposedly ended, and they did it without fuss. One of those rooms was a room for me for Friday night, a reservation which I made myself with the special events manager. First impressions arriving were pretty good. If you are not valeting a car (which is really expensive) that needs to stand for about 10 minutes while you unload, I would highly recommend entering on the Monroe and NOT the Wabash side. The L passing overhead on Wabash is deafening. The porters brought out two carts to carry our suitcases and 6 dresses (for my mom, sister, and I for the rehearsal and the wedding). They told us to check in and get comfortable and they would bring it right up. They did, which was great service. Now when my sister and I got to the room, I was shocked to see how tiny it was.This was one of the older, not rehabbed rooms.  I mean, I know it's an old hotel, but still! I was calling as the bride for a 60-room wedding block and that was the best they had? I ended up hanging my dress from the air conditioning vent because the closet wasn't big enough for it, and we had to move it over like a curtain to exit the room. In terms of sleeping, I thought that the mattress in the room was too soft. You may think I was being a princess on the room size, but I definitely was not. The next morning, my sister/maid of honor forced me to ""sleep in"" (awoke at 5:30am -- sleep fail), and then she ordered us room service. When the server arrived, he said, ""Good morning -- wow, this is a small room!"" THAT's how you know it's a small room -- when the man who has probably seen half the hotel and who is probably coached on making you feel like a welcomed guest comments on it! Anyway, the deluxe oatmeal my sister got us was very good.   That afternoon, we checked into a suite. Wooooooooohooooo! Talk about an upgrade! For about twice the price, we got five times the space: two bathrooms, a master bedroom, a dining room, a full desk, a living room/TV space, and a half kitchen. It was completely redone, as was the entire 10th floor. It was the perfect space to cyclone through before your big day -- shoes all over the floor, flower boxes, bobby pins flying everywhere. That suite could handle it. I slept like a rock in there. The regular rooms being cleaned that I peeked into while going down the hallways also looked very nice. If you have the cash or are willing to splurge for a special occasion, I say do it! The rich, ornate lobby and city streets that surround the Palmer House are gorgeous and perfect for touring, entertainment, and for photography. The lobby bar serves some very good drinks, including a seriously decked-out Bloody Mary. One thing about the lobby bar though -- the bartenders were pretty creepy to me. Another friend described them as total jerks. We had reserved a separate suite for the wedding after-party, and that purpose was expressly communicated to the Palmer House. The hotel failed to move one very ornery guest next door to the suite who was complaining at 4pm about noise coming from the suite when 6 friends were watching a football game. So we knew there was going to be trouble later. Sure enough, at 1:00am when our guests come back, there's a knock on the door. 3 hotel staff tell us we have to stop. My husband flatly and loudly tells them that that's not a solution we'll accept because they knew the purpose of the room and they knew this guest who was complaining was a problem earlier. I also reminded them about the business we're driving to the hotel. Eventually, one of the staff persons gets the brilliant idea to take us down to one of the party/conference rooms on the lower level of the hotel.  Way to problem solve! We pick up all the champagne and music and follow him, and the party merrily continued on until 5:30am (sans me and Alex). The next morning, we had a nice farewell breakfast at the hotel. I would avoid anything on biscuits -- they were too buttery or something. The texture was off. We continued to lounge around in the hotel lobby with friends and family for about 2 hours after we checked out without hassle. Friends of ours who were staying in Chicago for several days but had checked out of the Palmer House that morning were able to leave their bags with the front desk for at least 24 hours.",4,1,0,0

The room had a desk and a chair, but no extra comfy chair. No dresser to store my clothing. The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it.

Apparently there where three other weddings going on at the same time. The rooms have been remodeled. I stayed here a couple years ago and the place was looking its age. Now the rooms have been painted and fixed up. The furniture is more modern. However, the rooms are on the small side. Also the hotel is shaped like a U so some of the rooms are shrouded in darkness.

4558,NlmdKg9px1fDh8kuPOeQ-A,"When we got engaged, we planned our wedding almost exactly a year out.  Being a perfectionist and very organized, I started searching through bridal magazines and websites to plan our wedding.  I saw the Palmer House on the first day of looking at venues and knew that was where we would have our wedding.  Looking into the Grand & State Ballrooms just took my breath away.  We got married on Saturday, June 5th, 2010 at the Palmer House Hilton Chicago. We signed our contract with Mark Coy, a sales & catering coordinator at the Palmer House.  While he was pleasant in our meetings and would explain what we would need to do, I never really felt confident in his ability to make our day special.  I always needed to initiate questions to get answers and every meeting felt rushed because he had to be out the door by 6pm.  He always said ""no problem"" to everything but then there was a huge problem that finally had me in a  bridezilla moment.  In our initial room block we asked Mark to substitute two regular rooms for two suites.  Well, he put five suites on our block.  I had numerous phone calls from my guests that our block was full.  I didn't know until after the fact that each suite was taking 2 regular rooms out of our block.  In our meetings we always discussed increasing the number of rooms on our block as well.  Of course, he said ""no problem"" based on availability.  Well, a good coordinator would have told his client that the weekend of their wedding was also the largest convention in the city of Chicago.  So when we needed the additional rooms we heard ""sorry we're booked"".  Never once did he put the fear in our mind that we wouldn't have rooms for our guests.  At that moment I definitely knew that I could not work with someone who obviously could care less about our wedding.  We also had issues with charging of rooms as well.  I think that the rooms manager/department definitely needs some work in this location.  Our parents were charged the suite rate of $329, when they were supposed to be charged $289.  My mother-in-law was paying for her sister's room, but then they charged her sister's credit card.  Being an upscale hotel these issues shouldn't happen. I immediately asked for Jane Himmel to replace our coordinator as I heard she was the best coordinator there.  She is AMAZING and was our wedding angel.  We had set up a meeting for the next week as this was a Friday.  We were actually meeting with our florist on that evening at 6:30pm and she came to this meeting to meet us & go over a few details.  I was astonished that she would meet us on a Friday evening and she stayed until the end which concluded at 9:30pm.  She had to pretty much start from scratch and had two months to put it together.  The next day (Saturday) she emailed us a rough draft of our timeline & had forwarded some spreadsheets to fill out for her which included our parents info & our other vendors.  (The only thing Mark ever emailed me was a sample timeline of an early evening wedding and I am assuming I was to put it together)  She made us feel like she was going to make our wedding special and not just another cookie cutter wedding that our other coordinator was going to put together.  She could tell I was feeling stressed from everything going on and she suggested Claudia Antony, a day of coordinator.  Now, I was feeling great and actually enjoying the final months of wedding planning.         Jane got us back on track with our reception and did more in two weeks than our first coordinator did in almost 10 months.  We are so appreciative for the amount of time and effort on her part to make all of the details of our wedding reception seamlessly play through the night.  She was patient, organized, professional and easily accessible.  She stayed through the majority of our wedding and was relentless in her effort to make us happy.  We couldn't think of favors and she provided us an idea for what we should do.  She guided us through our meal choices, wine choices (as we were not happy with the others offered to us) and came up with a cake option that was magnificent.  She surprised us at our reception with keys to the penthouse for our two day stay, our wedding night & the night after.  She ""WOWED"" us time after time.  Her job didn't end there as the next day we set up a brunch for 60 people.  She had everything set up beautifully in the Honore Ballroom for the conclusion of our wedding weekend.  Let's just say Jane went above & beyond in all matters pertaining to our wedding.  I am sure there are so many more details that Jane attended to that I couldn't even begin to think about.  I couldn't imagine a more beautiful start to our new life together!

It's the real deal.  The current version of the Palmer House opened in 1925 but it's origins date back to 1871.  Even if you don't stay here, stop by and have a martini at the lobby bar.  Soak up the atmosphere around you.  Think of all the history that has passed though this lobby and the people that have had a drink at this bar.  The roaring 20's, Black Friday 1929, WW II, heck it is even quite possible that Al Capone and his henchmen had a drink at this bar.  The rooms are small by modern standards and the bathrooms are very small.  Remember this hotel was built in 1925, and at that time these were large rooms.  The water pressure in the shower was very low but again this is a historic hotel and we were on the top floor.  As with most Hilton properties the bed is very comfortable.  Down pillows and comforters are always a hit in my book.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I feel that the bellmen and doormen outshined the rest of the staff I came in contact with.  They were sincerely friendly, funny and helpful.  During our departure, our bellman ran out into traffic on State Street to hail us a taxi.  It almost looked like a cop commandeering a car during a police chase.  I would most definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone doing the tourist thing in Chicago, especially if you are a history buff.",4,0,0,0

This morning at 7:00 (Note: that's 5 a.m. Pacific time, where I am coming from), I wake up to the sounds of hammering and what sounds like a router drill on the other side of the wall at the head of my bed.  No chance of sleep.  I called the front desk.  They were apologetic, but the hotel's full, they can't change my room until later.  So be warned: this hotel's under construction, and if you value SLEEP, you should ask for a room as far from the construction as possible.",2,2,0,0
4565,s1zWtLtuI9MtI,"This review is for Potters, the bar/lounge at Palmer. On balance this place is not bad, however; the service has been inconsistent on the last couple of visits. I came here with a friend on Saturday a couple months ago and found the place to be a perfect sanctuary: dark with plentiful bar snacks, non-hovering service, and an inventive cocktail menu. On my most recent visit, a rainy Friday after catching a preview exhibition at the Art Institute, the female server apparently couldn't be bothered. After ordering, it took a long time to get my drink (given that the crowd was moving more into dinner hour than happy hour), then again to get another round, and finally, the check, which another server, male this time, finally took care of. I would like to think that this lapse in service was not due to the fact that I was flying solo on this visit. There were also no snacks in evidence. Not certain if this is a new cost-cutting measure here or a sign of things to come. That day, the space also seemed to be filled with several young kids (think 9-13 year olds) as part of a family or other traveling group. Now, I am not anti-kid by any means, but these ankle-biters and their parents apparently didn't get the memo that children are to be seen and not heard.",2,1,1,1
4566,zDV3MoLQsAADTluWPGzzPQ,"Stayed here for five nights on a recent business trip. Overall, I was pleased with my experience, mainly because I paid $70/night through priceline. When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and I felt like I was not treated any differently just because I had booked through priceline. I requested and was able to get a queen-size bed and a room away from the El. While the view from the room left a little to be desired (my view was of other hotel rooms about 100 feet across from mine), I didn't hear any street noise or the train. However, I did notice that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear people having phone conversations next door as well as hallway noise. The room was a little on the small side, but clean and well-designed. The location is excellent. It's two blocks away from Michigan Ave and the Art Institute. Three blocks away from Millenium Park. Entrances to the Red Line are one block away. I won't comment much on the lobby, because that has been commented a lot here...needless to say, it's pretty impressive. As with most pricey hotels, they nickel and dime you here. Internet is $20/day and I believe there is a charge to use the gym facilities. If you can book this hotel for cheap on priceline, then I highly recommend staying here. I do not know if I would pay full-price for a room here though.",4,1,1,0

They oversold the event so it took waiting in line to do almost anything. I went to the bathroom right before midnight and the men guarding the doors refused to let me back in. They said the room was at capacity. How can that even happen? If you were responsible enough to only sell enough tickets that the main room wouldnt be at capacity then I wouldnt have spent $ 140 to be standing in a hallway by myself on new years stone cold sober. They wouldnt allow alcohol in the hotel rooms and if they found any reminants they would charge a $ 60 corkage fee. So greedy! Now back to the staff and maintenance. The conceirge had no idea when check out was, the starbucks staff yelled at me for no apparent reason and when we checked under the bed to make sure we didnt leave anything behind we found dirty dishes with food still stuck to them,an empty ice cream carton, and a bunch of used glasses.

4571,JRz3sweYb6K,"I just adore this hotel. It really is gorgeous. I'm a big fan of anything with a great history behind it, and this hotel is chalk full of interesting history. I love the architecture and how I feel like I'm stepping back into the 1940s-1950s whenever I walk the halls with the movie stars from one of the best eras in Hollywood. I've been here twice (though didn't stay the night-my mom did) and I can't wait to go back just to take it all in again. This time I went with my mom, boyfriend, and his mom to wander around and check out all the fancy stuff. There was a wedding reception and a prom going on, so we didn't see the smaller rooms, but we did venture into the Grand Ballroom, and boy was it ever grand! They don't call it that for nothing, let me tell you. The chandeliers were just gorgeous. We wandered all over and encountered the most beautiful piano I've ever seen. Sadly they'd locked it (too many people trying to play it, I imagine), so I didn't get to see what I'm sure are beautiful keys. Sigh. Maybe someday. I'm not entirely sure what Gene is talking about, I have yet to encounter a small room there. We booked a room both times using hotwire and were able to score a $78 (for a saturday and sunday, friday for my bf's mom was $73) deal. Good sized room, double beds, and with a window looking at another wing of the hotel. The only thing I didn't really like was that there was no screen in the window, but as I wouldn't go there with kids, it's not that big of a deal. I can't wait until I can stay there myself (though it'll be a while since I live one el stop away).",4,0,0,0
4572,T-EFDEWkeZFFTdbOg7QYOA,"Something always seems to go wrong when I visit Chicago, last time our car got towed at 2am (course our luggage, maps & most $ was in the car ) so we had to wander the streets of Chicago aimlessly... This time the issue was the hotel: Plus 1 star: location Plus 1 star: gorgeous lobby, historical hotel Minus 1 star- for PAPER THIN WALLS Minus 1 star- for being woken by maid each morning Minus 1 star for not only not allowing my boyfriend in the room when his card stopped working & not being helpful to him in any way. I have travelled throughout the US, Europe & Asia and I don't remember any hotel, motel, or any other lodging where the maids come before checkout or at least 11am.  This might not have been that problemmatic but the paperthin walls did not help. FRI:    9:23am Maid service next door (to those that flew in late & are on CA time that felt like 7:23am about 5 hours BEFORE I had planned to wake).   We're not talking about faintly hearing the vaccuum, we're talking hearing her push all the hangers in the closet together ... that's how thin the walls were. I crawled out of bed & put a ""do not disturb"" sign up.  A few minutes later our door starts shaking and this weird noise like someone's rubbing against the door Apparently they polish them every morning  -- I'd have to say she didn't read the sign about NOT DISTURBING US. Later that night got to listen to our neighbors have sex. SAT:  Maid service comes through at 8:30am! (which, to someone on PST felt like 6:30am wakeup, esp. after being at a wedding reception until midnight the night before!). SUN.   3:14am woken by screaming fight next door (apparently some jerk ditched his GF).   7:00am woken up by someone in the room on the other side decided it was a good time to SING. 8:30-9:30am Maid knocking on neighbouring doors woke us up later that morning (we'd finally learned to put the do not disturb (or polish our door!) sign up at night). Went out to visit a friend about an hour outside of Chicago.  Get a call from my BF.  His card won't work on the room. He went to the front desk & since his name wasn't on the reservation they wouldn't give him a new card (Fair enough, appreciate their not giving one to just anyone). What really pissed me off was they refused to consider any reasonable alternative to prove his claim or assist him. I mean he did have a hotel card, he knew the name of the person in the room, he knew the room #, he could describe the room & our luggage, offered to give them the credit card # the room was charged too - he wasn't just coming in randomly & fishing for info. They told him having me call & verify him would NOT be enough to let him in. He then asked them to look at the key and see if they could see why it didn't work.  Theyclaimed the key was fine and if it was valid it should work (accusing him of not only having found a key but mysteriously knowing the room # & name associated with the card)?.  They also refused to send someone up with him so he could prove the card didn't work and that his belongings were really in the room. So he called me upset that he wasn't allowed in our room, he was exhausted from a long day and I was not expected back for at least 4 hours and was at least an hour away. I called and demanded to speak to someone who would attempt to assist him and got someone to add his name to the reservation and they let him in - but it definitely soured our afternoon. Other things that I would not have bothering mentioning except that I was so sleep deprived & cranky about the above instances : The front of the building is under construction (which is a shame, would've liked to see it).  It would have been nice if they told me this on the phone when I called for the address, they gave me the street that had no entrance, instead of the street that had a working entrance). And I suppose it was my fault for asking for closest subway line when coming from the airport (not knowing there were separate train/non-train lines), so instead of giving us the stop 15 feet in front of the front door that was exactly on our line from the airport - I was told to get out at a stop about 5 blocks away... still, deductive reasoning should have told her that confused tourist from out of town coming from Midway on the Orange line, probably wants the closest Orange line stop, not to spend more time transferring to some other line for a further stop & then toting luggage to the hotel.",2,0,0,0
4573,DSOcoPaLpcK2D8Vt3H5C0g,"stayed five nights here for a conference last summer.  this was the chosen conference hotel so this was where we stayed.   what i loved: the hotel is gorgeous.  the lobby &amp; ballrooms speak to an era of opulent charm.  i think i gave myself a stiff neck because i couldn't help looking up at the beautiful architecture. the doormen &amp; bellmen are super duper friendly and helpful.   it is located in the middle of everything.  there is so much to see and do and it's all a nice, leisurely walk or cab ride away. shopping!  there are several stores lining the block of the hotel, and even more a little ways down if you don't mind the walk. what i didn't like: while the hotel didn't lack for elevators to get you to your room, if you had other people in your party who were staying on a different floor, there was a big chance you had to hop onto a different elevator from the one servicing your floor to access their room. cell phone reception in some of the rooms sucks.  especially if you have at&amp;t.  i thought i'd be fine with my iphone as my internet connection, but i couldn't get a signal in my room.  if i walked down the hall towards the elevators i got full bars.  but that's not convenient when it's  2 am and you want to make a phone call home. other reviewers are not kidding when they say the walls are paper thin.  you can hear full on conversations from people walking down the halls and in adjacent rooms.  luckily, no one was staying in the room next to me. it's almost like a lottery on what size room you will get.  i booked all the rooms for our staff (single occupancy king beds) and some people got large rooms, some got closet sized spaces.  my room was fine since i was the only one staying in it, and i actually had a large bathroom compared to other co-workers rooms.  the reason was my room was renovated for ADA accessibility, so i had a wider door and railings in the restroom, a lower closet rod, and a second peephole at belly-button height.  good for accommodating someone in a wheelchair or a little person.  not so good when you're an average height person and you need to hang some long dresses. for the number of rooms the hotel boasts (over 1,000) and it's ability to accommodate conference crowds), i wasn't too pleased with the concierge/housekeeping accessibility.  i called each at least three times during my stay and was left each time with an endlessly ringing phone. hotel amenities are not free?!  it costs extra to use the hotel pool and the gym?!  now that is an extreme rip-off, expecially when lots of folks are paying a couple hundred bucks per night's stay.  even when i asked  for an extended check-out from 11 AM to 12:30 PM, i was told it would be a $25 charge. overall, it did it's job in providing a safe, comfortable place to stay while in chicago.  i would stay here again, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice of places to stay.",3,0,0,0

We were given our keys and sent on our way only to find that she had given us a room with ONE double bed which is not what we had reserved.  You would think the front desk clerk would have thought something was amiss when she checked us in.  My husband was standing right there and at 6'6 would barely fit in that bed by himself, let alone the both of us.  I immediately called down only to be placed on hold for an eternity so the manager could be consulted.  The manager never even bothered to speak to us to apologize and had the clerk handle it. I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a ""Days Inn"" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have.  It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties.  The TV was extremely dated.  No wifi!!!!!!

4760,TCOPwhP3M0EqCJcT2_qwhA,"Walking into the main lobby of the Palmer House for the first time is a great experience. Everything is beautiful with high open ceilings, historic woodwork and molding, great fixtures and tapestries. This is definitely a historic place in Chicago that anyone visiting should see.The hotel is close to many great things in Chicago. We came to see a concert at the Chicago Theater and it was an easy walk to there.I'm giving it three stars because we booked our room online and it was supposed to be 2 queens. When we arrived, we were notified that they had awarded all the 2 Queen bedrooms to Hilton Honors members and all they had left was single King rooms. I was with a relative, and we decided we could bare sleeping together for one night. When we arrived in the room, it looked as though this was at one time a janitor's closet converted to a bedroom. The room was absolutely tiny. Our bed took up most of the room and there was very little space to walk around or place our bags. The mini-fridge didn't even open all the way because it hit the end of the bed. Plus, our mini-fridge wasn't even working.Sooo....unless you're a Hilton Honor's member, I would be leery of booking rooms here. There are no guarantees and it definitely felt like they treated people who booked from on-line discount sites (such as http://hotels.com) as second class citizens. Still, if you can get a good deal I would recommend you give it a try because it is such a beautiful and historic building.",3,0,0,0

She told me they did not have any king beds, but could give me a non smoking room and negatively refered to the fact i got the room off priceline several times.  When we got to the hotel, we asked the man who was helping us at the front desk if there were any king beds and he said he had plenty and switched us.  We got into the room, it was VERY small, there was a red stain on the wallpaper on one wall and on the other wall the wallpaper was coming off the wall.  The carpet was dirty and we both slipped on the very slippery bathroom floor.  I wanted to use the gym, but was told it was $18.00 a day to use it and the internet was another $ 14.00.  On top of that, you are charged for parking (either valet or in the garage) by the day (between $40 and $51 dollars a day)!!!

4767,kmvDGM0LJ5ugCgqREYGWdg,"The Palmer House was an enormous disappointment. Sure the lobby is nice, but the room was shabby.  Right in downtown Chicago, Hilton has managed to create the kind of room I'd expect to find in a Motel wedged between a whorehouse and an airport runway deep in a Florida swamp.The room we had was tiny and worn out; the carpet was faded, the wallpaper was peeling, the sink wouldn't drain and the cheap and cheesy  ""Empire"" furniture was stained and scratched. The room was also very noisy. The constant rattle and hum of the building's mechanical systems was on par with a flight on a regional jet. This wheezing symphony of air conditioning and elevators was punctuated occasionally by the three-year-old-with-kettle-drum sound of the showers in the adjacent rooms. Finally, the room was humid. No matter how we set the AC, the room, the sheets, the towels, everything felt damp.If you drive, be prepared to pay their ""specially arranged"" exorbitant parking fee, in our case it was a third the cost of the room, at the garage across the street.

4842,z6gn7xAqFayFU63U3pTjAQ,"As we arrived to the hotel's proximity on Wacker, we could hear its name being shouted before we saw it. The base of the hotel was covered in groups of picketers with angry signs beating pots and pans. Once we made our way through the angry crowd, we found the lobby to be very impressive and immense. It took us a few minutes before we could locate the actual front desk that was up the escalator and on the second floor. Our room was on the Regency Level on the 34th floor with amazing views of the lake, Chicago River and the downtown skyline. The bed was very comfortable and the room was of a modern style. It was a nice looking room; however, it was pretty dusty. In the bathroom, the water pressure was so weak that it was a let down since they had such a nice looking shower. Another upsetting factor was that you could still hear the angry crowd from the street below banging their pans and shouting at all hours of the day from the 34th floor! It was horrible. The first night that we were there, we had a lady use a key card and enter our room (even with our privacy sign on the door) a bit after 10pm! We were in bed and were very shocked to find a person opening our room's door. We immediately called the front desk who then transferred me to security. About 20 or so minutes later, security arrived at our room to ""interrogate"" the lock. He said it was most likely a ""benign"" situation and probably housekeeping (after 10pm!?!). He fiddled with the lock and then disappeared without a final explanation to me and my husband. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well that night. With every noise we heard, we thought someone was coming in our room again. With us being unsure of housekeeping, or who ever was coming in our room, we decided to not have our room serviced during our stay. From the sound of it, they wouldn't have serviced it anyways. We spoke with another family in the building and they had been there three days waiting for someone to service their room. They were starting to make bets on whether or not their room would be clean each time they went back into their room. Basic cleanliness is a necessity for any hotel--it doesn't matter how large and how many rooms you have. In result of the picketers, more than half of the hotel restaurants were not in working order and were closed. In addition, there was no room service. We specifically chose a Hyatt hotel in the Chicago area so we would have restaurants close by since this was our first time to the city. This was a let down after flying from the West Coast. We decided to eat at the breakfast buffet on our second day and I would not recommend it. For the two of us, it cost $40 some dollars and the food was less than impressive. I only ate a third of a Denver omelet (the eggs were runny and the vegetables were crunchy), a piece of cantaloupe and some yogurt. Should have left the hotel for some real food for a fraction of the price! The proximity to sightseeing things and the ability to get a cab in a hurry is great.

4846,FbXsXzn-jaH1tykELt_u7A,"Paid more than $200 per night in this hotel with high expectations and after I had heard so much about it in Yelp. One of the most disappointing stays I have had in such a talked about hotel. I had been told I was getting a room with two queen beds. When I checked in, I was told the room is not available so I was given a king sized bed in supposedly a renovated wing of the hotel. After getting into the room, I found out that it was renovated for sure - the room was still smelling heavily of paint. The bed was a king size roll out bed - yes, you got that right! A roll out bed for $200+ per night. There were no lights on the side of the bed so one had to get up everytime and go the the lights at the corner of the room to switch them on/off. All night, there was periodic slamming noise come out just outside my door after every 30 mins or so. I was too tired to find out and just wanted to get a night's rest. In the morning I figured out, it was the ice machine and all night due to some issue, there was a crashing noise coming from it.

5021,UOeUECqpwiohgcJ0VVOE8w,"For the price and previous ratings, I expected to have a nice relaxing time at the W. I was there for a wedding, and I have traveled to Chicago many times before, but this was my first time staying at the W. First, there is no direct shuttle for guests from Midway or O'Hare. Second, there are 4 elevators for 33 floors so there is ALWAYS a long wait (at least 10 minutes) for a lift. Third, the cleaning staff came to clean my room at 9am on a Saturday morning and never came back to clean, replenish towels, or make the beds. Forth, was charged for mini bar items that neither I, nor my guest, used. Fifth, when I checked in around 1130pm the previous Friday, there was a very loud music in the lobby lounge making it nearly impossible to hear the receptionist tell me where my room was, nor was there anyone there to help with my bag. Lots of negatives for the ""5-star"" hotel. However, there were times where the staff redeemed itself: The strap to my heel broke and I was able to call the concierge to get super glue to fix it, and the valet hailed a cab for me and helped load my bags. Also, after contacting the managers regarding the extraneous charges, they did reimburse me. However, if given the option to stay here again I would rather stay at one of the hotels down the street a few blocks down where I've stayed there before and had much better service",2,0,0,0

We couldn't go out of town but wanted to get out of the house! Even though the W is close to our condo we decided to spend the weekend here since we are big W fans! I had flowers waiting in the room when we arrived so the hotel knew it was our anniversary. They upgraded our room and treated us like it was our honeymoon. They went above and beyond our already high expectations due to years of staying at W hotels. The bartenders knew us by name and knew our drinks. The food was amazing! The pool was better then our health club. All amenities were first class.The view is one of the best in the city and worth the room rate alone. The customer service was top notch.  I will have all out of town guests stay here going forward. This hotel is the overall package. There are still other W hotels I like better but as far as hotels in Chicago this one tops them all. From the min we walked in the door we know we made the right choice. Keep up the great customer service on every level and this hotel will always be one of the best and our home away from home right here in Chicago!

5024,hCaqFNSOUlgoeM7GDvtRnw,"Normally I'm not a fan of places with über-trendy, über-clubby vibes, but I have a soft spot for the W Lakeshore. I've stayed here a few times in the past few years and each time I've been impressed. I've even been impressed when I wasn't a guest here. Everyone-- from the doormen to the front desk to the cleaning ladies to the fitness room attendants to the concierge-- have been always been accommodating and professional.  It was here where I first learned what concierges did. I used to walk by hotel concierges and wonder what the heck they did all day. At the W Lakeshore, they do everything! They make rental car reservations if you want to drive out to the 'burbs, mail letters even if you don't have a stamp, reserve tables at popular restaurants--the whole shebang! Once I wandered into the W when I wasn't staying there, all lost and wind-shocked, and the concierge looked up the restaurant I was trying to get to and gave me directions. Now that's service.  The rooms are a little on the small side, but the view of the lake more than makes up for it. At a lot of hotels with supposed lake views, you can only see the lake way, way off in the distance. At the W, however, you can take a shower, open the divider between the bathroom and bedroom, and all you see is water when you look out the window. Now that's priceless. As a much-appreciated security precaution, you have to insert your room card to use the elevators. The hotel exercise room has nice equipment, but I usually just run along the lakeshore path because it's right across the street. The complimentary Bliss products are a little too citrusy-smelling for my liking, but that's just a preference thing. I can't comment on the restaurant or bars because I've never tried them, but the bar/lounge/restaurant area on the first floor is full of people in stylish clothes at night so I'm assuming it'd be a good place to pick up people if that's your thing. Tip: If you're part of the Starwood Preferred Guest program, you get early check-in and late check-out (4PM!!!!), even if you didn't book the room through the Starwood website. Also, most hotel programs don't give you reward points if book through an outside party, but I've gotten about 50-60 SPG points per stay in the past (which, admittedly, is basically nothing but still appreciated).",5,0,0,0
5025,DFGJroljdjzVmX-H65FHtA,"This is the last time I book any of my colleagues and clients at this hotel. We've booked with W Chicago-Lakeshore  in the past and there has always been something but this time around was the final straw. I booked a hotel stay for one of my colleagues and my colleague was suppose to check in on Sunday. I called a week prior to his check in date to prepaid for his stay (since every time I asked for a CC Auth form, I never received it). The account woman took everything over the phone and said my colleague was all set. Here comes Sunday, the day my colleague is set to check in. They will not let him check in because they require him to put his card down for room & tax. My question is...what's the point of prepaying for a room when the guest is going to have to put down his/her card for ROOM & TAX plus incidentals. My colleague called me explaining the situation that Sunday night. Then I called the hotel and spoke to the night manger, who name begins with a G. She herself told me that she can see that an authorization has been made to his account but the account woman clearly didn't input the hard swipe. Another question I have to ask, why is that our problem? That was negligence on your employee's part not ours. Then, for her to say we have to put down for incidentals and a night stay in order to stay at the hotel(which would have been $650+, after I repeatedly told her I would send the details over to her first thing in the morning and my guest can not pay for this. I don't think Ms. G understands that everyone doesn't have $650+ to give at the drop of a hat. Which is why the company was paying for his travel.To cut a long story short, my colleague was waiting outside of the hotel for about to 2hrs, at night after flying in from NY to be told he couldn't stay at their hotel because a W Chicago Lakeshore employee was negligent in processing a CC Auth form. Which lead for me to intensely search for a hotel for my colleague to stay in for that night and the next 3 days.  I am just beyond frustrated with this hotel.

I was tempted to borrow a pair 'long-term', but that just ruins it for everyone else. Lots of treadmills, elliptical machines, a fair variety of weight machines, even warm towels for wiping off. Top notch. - The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The bed was not as great as the heavenly beds at the starwood hotels, but still pretty great. I had a handicapped accessible room, so the bathroom was huge, but where's the bathroom counter? There was nowhere to put anything. Housekeeping services were great.

379267,Bb00wdNBY8GOtiJ_-a_liQ,"About two months before our wedding I reserved five rooms at the Hyatt for our special guests.  For some reason we had to split up the reservations between two names.  This was the cause of much confusion down the road.  Then, when we tried to get an adjustment to the pricing during a special sale, some of our rooms were canceled.  While I received email notices about everything concerning the rooms, I never received any cancellation notifications.  I only happen to find out about the cancellation when I called the night before to ask a few questions about the check in process for my guests.  We all ended up with rooms at the reserved pricing, but only after a few phone calls and too many minutes at the front desk. Aside from their difficult small group room reservation process, it was an OK place for our guests.  The rooms and facilities were clean.  The bar in the main lobby provided a fun place for our guests to end the evening. The cafe food was good and the breakfast buffet had a very nice spread.   Overall, we enjoyed staying there but I will not select this place for large groups in the future.

I did not stay in the rooms but I do recommend a little chat (with a glass of wine I might add) pre-dinner in the glorious and captivating lobby area.  You can order a glass of wine from the lobby area bar and sit back in luxury before you head on for a night of fun.   I also took a bit of time to visit the Downtown Bar for a leisurely afternoon salad.  While the wine by the glass list is not that large, they do serve the wine in very nice glasses with a smart style.  They give you a personal carafe and only pour about 1/3 into your glass and leave the carafe with you to pour at your own leisure.  Being in the wine business I love this concept so that I can properly swirl my wine and enjoy at my own pace.

The hotel and staff (Jenny Silvestri & Hope wedding coordinators) are extremely helpful and attentive to your needs. The view from the altitude room is breathtaking and on Saturday evenings they have fireworks at Navy Pier, an added bonus. Every single plate served at dinner was clear by the time dessert was served. I have never heard so many people compliment food at a wedding before - it was incredible. Anytime myself or anyone at the wedding for that fact needed something a staff member was there within minutes to assist. The hotel itself is beautiful and very accomodating. The hotel rooms are a little small but hotel rooms are for sleeping not spending all of your time in so that did not bother me. We opted for one of their suites with a small living area that was perfect. We have stayed at this hotel a few times before and after our wedding and the staff was just as helpful as on our wedding day.

472620,YzAO8I0uiUaxwi_8MX07WQ,"A very solid 4-star stay! Obviously, I have not stayed at too many hotels in Chicago. As a former resident, I never had much need. But on a recent trip, it became a necessity so I set out to find the best priced hotel room downtown. A hotwire search for ""4 stars and above"" near ""downtown"" landed me a $111/night rate at the Hyatt Regency. For Thursday-Sunday! $111/night!? Chicago in the summer!? I feared that this would be a dump due to the price, but was relieved somewhat when I saw their announcement on Yelp detailing their complete renovation of all 2,000+ rooms. Wow, big hotel. Yes, indeed. This is a ""convention"" hotel, with multiple towers, huge convention spaces below and all around. It's massive. As luck would have it, the SoniCare toothbrush convention was here during my stay, so there were a lot of out-of-towners with brilliant smiles bounding around everywhere. Could be worse, right!? When you enter the lobby it actually looks more like an airport or a huge mall. Nonetheless, my check-in was quite smooth and I was on my way up to my room on the 23rd floor. What i found was quite impressive! A small room (1 Queen bed), but very modern, stylish, clean and comfortable. Flat screen TV. Very updated and you can definitely tell the remodel went full force. Things felt crisp and clean, the carpet fresh. It was just a really nice room. And on the 23rd floor...though I didn't have a river view (could've upgraded for $20, but wasn't spending a whole lot of time there!) was looking out over office buildings and Chicagoans bustling around to work and play. Suggestion, if you're here on a weekend and there is a big convention (usually), just ask to be put on those floors. Typically people from Sonicare are not going to be rowdy and loud. 18 years olds on vacation, another story. My room was quiet and peaceful at all times.   The service during my stay was also right on key. Never had an issue. I'd never eat or drink at the lounges/Stetson's with all the wonderful options nearby and in Chicago, but they had a nice snack/bev area for quick snacks. It's not cheap or anything, but it does in a pinch. Parking: You can valet (which is probably a lot) or you can park in one of the underground lots and walk a few blocks to save about half. I think we paid around $20/night. Much better and you don't have to wait in a crazy valet line in the morning! Any complaints? Just one small one. The elevators get super jammed up around the 10-11am hour, and I waited 20 minutes for one to get downtstairs on Saturday morning because all the Sonicare ladies were going somewhere at the same time. Like all 4,000 of them. So, that didn't work so hot, but everything else considered...this was indeed a ""4 star hotel, downtown"" and for $111/night! *Also, free wi-fi. I'd stay again. If I need a hotel in Chicago, that is. Show owner comment »",4,13,9,4
475722,YKlWB2UrutITdFyCsg2tpQ,"3.5 stars actually. It pains me to score a W property so low, as I LOVE the W concept - I love the loud music and DJ spinning records in the lobby as you walk in, the trendy and modern decor, the party scene...love it all!  BUT, sadly as far as SPG properties go, I think I'll start staying at Westin's instead of W's.  In my experience the W's are so inconsistent around the country....some are great and some are just okay but the one consistent theme is how small and simpllistic the rooms are. We had a long travel day to come to Chicago and I was so excited to check in to the W Lakeshore until we were told they only had double bed rooms left....double?  Seriously?  I can deal with queen beds, but double?  Since we were there for 5 nights, I asked if we could switch to a king room as it became available.  Luckily there would be a room the very next night...so only 1 night in a double room!  The receptionist was very pleasant and accommodating.   Now - about those rooms.....the double room was ridiculous.  It was incredibly small - you had to walk sideways around the beds.  The batroom was TINY.  The magnifying mirror didn't work, the toilet only flushed if you held the handle down the whole time, and the shower was a very small tub/shower with a curtain.  The entire room just looked tired and dated from the popcorn ceilings, to the hideous burgundy curtain they call a duvet cover, to the broke down bathroom.  What a huge dissappointment!  Now we couldn't wait to switch rooms!  The room switch was painless - they moved all our stuff while we were out and about so when we came back in the afternoon it was all taken care of.  The new king room is MUCH better.  It's the same size but appears much larger as there's only one bed and a chaise lounge.  The duvet was a nice white one and the bathroom was larger with a European rain shower.  It was seriously night and day.   The staff are incredibly helpful and nice.  They called to make sure our luggage arrived and to make sure we were happy with our room.  They brought us an in-room coffee pot upon our request and were happy to do so.   This property would get 4 or 5 stars if they'd update their rooms.....thus next time I'll try the Westin.",3,0,0,0

Right next to the water and not right in the middle of downtown were traffic can be congested. Our room was on the 26th floor and had a great view. They had a floating bed which was pretty cool. There was a convenient bar/restaurant in the hotel. The food was decent as well as the drinks. The bad. There was no bed cover sheet on our bed. It was simply a regular sheet that was tucked in. For someone who moves around while he sleeps, the bottom sheet constantly came undone and was exposing the bare mattress. Not very comfortable. The room size was a little small as well. As soon as I walked in, the doorway was narrow and there wasn't much room to maneuver around. Also, the walls were very thin so we could hear everything from our neighbors on both sides.

For eligible business travelers, they have a weekly business traveler breakfast with coffee, yogurt, bagels, pastries, and fruit. Once in a while, they offer hot food. I thought this was a really nice perk. At check-in, you receive a card that will admit you to the business traveler breakfast by the bar.

I visited in August 2012 and it looks HORRIBLE.  The rooms are small and out of date.  The curtain covering the closet reminds me of a hotel room that you rent by the hour.  The shutters in the bathrooms don't make sense and you will really notice them if you are sharing the room with somebody.  I felt like the toilet was in the middle of the room!!!! The corridors are DIRTY.  The facade outside needs to be replaced.   You have to wait 10 minutes sometimes for an elevator and when you get in the elevator, the carpet and rug are dirty and worn.  How hard is that to replace?   The rooms are so small that they have either one queen bed or two double beds (I switched rooms).    The small indoor pool is always full of children.  The fitness center is fine for a hotel of this size, but again, I don't think the maid service cleans it.   It seems like I'm a negative person but there were just too many problems.   I cannot understand why the W chain or Starwood would want to be associated with this hotel.",1,0,0,0
645054,_rpe2n9N7tZGQkC_bF6hgw,"Ahhhh, my 200th review. Such a milestone number calls for a review of mammoth proportions. Or, should I say, a review of an establishment WITH mammoth proportions! That would be the W Chicago. Indeedy. The check-in seemed innocuous enough. ""Would you like a high floor?"" I was asked. I paused, thinking of how I had always vowed to never work or live above the 23rd floor. Not usually an option where I live now, though and perhaps I was missing New York, so I blurted out, ""Yes!"" I thought of those amazing views of Lake Michigan and after I was whisked up to that dee luxe hotel room in the sky, I discovered that I indeed was privy to such views. Me likey! What I was looking forward to at the W besides the astonishing view (Lake Michigan appeared lovely and gray and frothy on this first week of March), was of course the Bliss products. And there they were. And yes, they were replenished daily if you took away what you used. Besides the view, the Bliss products, beds that you could die happy in (sleeping in a cloud, my friends!), spacious room and well, the flat screen TV (that I never used. Excuse me, but it was 14 dollars to rent Precious. Thanks, that's more than it costs to see Precious in a New York movie theater...true the TV IS the size of an art house theater), I need to rave about the gym. The gym was so awesome, that I woke up daily excited to use it. The reason for this was that the equipment was brand new and way better than my local gym,and it also looked out at that awesome view of the lake! How inspiring! I felt like I could swim in that lake, straight across to Canada! (I feel this way when staring at the East River, just so you know. I hate considering pedestrian limitations). The free rides courtesy of Acura, were also a nice amenity and the driver was a really friendly woman. Besides all of the above, I really enjoyed my evenings spent savoring a glass of red wine or two while I worked in the ""Living Room"" (basically the lounge area where you walk in--it's quite spacious and the couches are comfy...stellar service, too), despite the fact that there were a few sleazy sorts that seemed to think that I knew ""cool places to go at night."" Um, if I was all about being on the town, would I be sitting here drinking wine and working on my laptop, genius? I digress. Because the Living Room closes at midnight (on WEEKNIGHTS ONLY...caveat...read on), I was then ""forced"" to enjoy an absinthe cocktail or two from the Whiskey Sky Lounge (separate review). Everything changed on Friday night however. I arrived back to the hotel at a respectable 10pm and oh, I felt like Sookie Stackhouse stumbling upon her peaceful house taken over by that nasty Maryann and her crapulous minions. The place had turned into...WTF? I should have known. Oh, I should have known. After all, I had an almost identical stay that started out quite well at the Hotel On Rivington NYC, http://www.yelp.com/biz/… which is like a boutique hotel version of the W. But after 10pm on Saturday night, all hell broke loose when all the trendy nightlife lovers descended on THOR and caused the red rope barriers.   All I could think was, ugh, get out of my way, whippersnappers desperate for some good times. I say this with all the conviction of a crochety old lady, by the way. The worst part was when I realized at 1:30 am, desperately trying to turn in early after a night ignoring the fact that I was boozeless (no, I am NOT about to spend 60 dollars for a 12 dollar bottle of wine on the mini bar), that the goddamn Sky Bar was DIRECTLY above my room! And the elevators were right next to my room!!! All I could hear were the revelers going up and down (and ""down on,"" no doubt. Heavens!) I had no idea what time closing time was, so I called downstairs and barely got an apology for the fact that the entire floor above me was vibrating with some of the worst mash-ups known to man. You'd think the guy who checked me in might have WARNED me of the fact that I might be bothered by the noise of the club that was directly above my room, right? And then there was the godawful heating system. If my stay wasn't during a Chicago winter, I probably wouldn't be too bothered by this, but this was a heating system that automatically turned off once the thermostat hit the temperature you enter (and did NOT turn back on once the thermostat dips down again, WTF?) It got cold in this room. I mean, down to 60 degrees. In a luxury hotel, that is unforgivable. It shouldn't be rocket science to figure out a thermostat. All of that said, I had a pretty good stay here and would probably stay at at a W again (just not under the Sky Lounge). I knock off two stars because it's a W hotel and I feel that they set a pretty high standard that wasn't quite met here. Oh and those bamboo shades and door to the bathroom that provide NO privacy whatsoever should you be sharing the room? Nice conce",3,7,5,5
