## OPAN 6609: Text Analytics
### Final Project: Yelp Hotel Reviews

#### Assignment Summary
You are leading a new branded hotel and you need to know what customers who give poor reviews of hotels tend to bring up. To minimize poor service, your analytics team will examine hotel reviews using topic modeling to identify what reviewers who give poor reviews actually write about in their experience to ensure your hotel focuses special attention and ensures high-quality services in those domains.
